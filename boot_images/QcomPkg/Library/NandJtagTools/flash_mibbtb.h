                Bad Block Table Block Definitions

DESCRIPTION
  This header file gives the external definition of the Bad Block Table
  Block, located in the third non-bad block in NAND flash for Multi-Image
  Boot targets.
  
  The bad block table is allowed to extend as long as needed but must be
  contained within the block.
