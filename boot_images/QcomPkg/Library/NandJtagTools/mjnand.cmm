;  Name:
;    MJNAND.CMM
;
;  Description:
;    FLASH Programming Script file for Lauterbach JTAG/ICD TRACE32.
;    Supports Multi-Image Boot only
;
;    There is a combination of JTAG/ICD FLASH.* commands and our own
;    extensions to those commands used.  Because of the nature of the NAND
;    flash, we must send a "preparation" command before FLASH.program
;    command, and then a "finish" command after, to tell the MNAND program
;    that the last page of code should be flushed to the NAND flash
;    and to write the boot information block.
;
;  Execution:
;    Inside the debugger, type at the command line: "do mjnand".  Make
;    menu choices as directed.
;
;  Command line args handled by MJNAND:
;
;     MJNAND [DEBUG] [TRUSTED] [NOMENU] [BUILDID] [EXTPATH]
;
;       DEBUG is optional but MUST be first if used.  Will make MJNAND verbose
;
;       TRUSTED is optional but MUST be first or second if used.  Must be second
;              if DEBUG is used.  Will set security mode to TRUSTED, otherwise,
;              default security is NON-TRUSTED
;
;       NOMENU[(APPS|MODEM)] is used by JNLOAD and will cause all header and code
;               images to be loaded with no intervention and MJNAND to become 
;               very quiet.  This option requires a valid build ID.
;               NOMENUAPPS will load only apps and apps boot images and headers.
;               NOMENUMODEM will only load all of the modem images.
;               NOMENUCEFS will load all of the modem and apps images along with 
;                          the CEFS (apps or modem) image.
;
;       NOMENUAPPSEXT will be used to load an external apps image (ie from a
;               split build).  In this case the path to the external binaries 
;               should be passed as the EXTPATH parameter
;
;       BUILDID is a valid Build ID and can be in the format of:
;
;           TMQQ
;
;       MJNAND will assume ../../build/ms/bin and will prepend BUILDID to
;         all image names.
;       If no BUILDID is given, MJNAND will provide a file chooser window
;         with its base in ../../build/ms/bin
;
;       EXTPATH is the path used to locate all of the needed external
;          binaries for a split WM build
;  Usage: 
;       do mjnand.cmm <BUILDID>
;       do mjnand.cmm NOMENU <BUILDID>
;       do mjnand.cmm NOMENUMODEM <BUILDID> 
;       do mjnand.cmm NOMENUCEFS <BUILDID> 
;       do mjnand.cmm NOMENUAPPS <BUILDID> 
;       do mjnand.cmm NOMENUAPPSEXT <BUILDID> <EXTPATH> 
;          e.g. do mjnand.cmm NOMENUAPPSEXT SDCABPS ../ext_bin
;       do mjnand.cmm NOMENUCUSTOM <BUILDID> <EXTPATH>
;
;  NOTE:  Because all headers and images are binary, they contain no
;         symbolic information.  Any symbol loading must be done outside
;         if MJNAND using an ELF version of the binary
