    @brief
    Approximate unsigned-inverse using linear 8-entry lookup table.

    @detail
    Given an unsigned input, return an approximation of 1/input, and a scale
    factor.
    The scale factor facilitates a variable input Q-factor.
    If input is 0, the output returned is result=0x7FFFFFFF, scale=0 i.e 0 
    is treated as a 1. Valid input range is 0-0xFFFFFFFF.

    Common explanation for the output of ...linlut8(), ...cubelut8() and 
    ...newt():-
      In the output pair, the result is a 31U number while the scale lies in 
      [0,31]. The output Q-factor is Qo= 31 + scale - Qi (Qi=input Q-factor). 
      For Qo outside [0,32], visualize the result as being prefixed (for 
      Qo>32) or suffixed (for Qo<0) with 0s, to have a total of |Qo| bits to 
      the left or right respectively (the Q-pt would be at the left or the 
      right end too) of the 32-bit result's LSB. 
      For e.g: 
        1. For input=0xffffffff, result ~=0x40000000, and scale=31 always. 
           If Qi=32, input numerically equals to (2^32-1)/2^32 ~=1 and 
           Qo=31+31-32=30. Thus output equals ~2^30/2^30=1. 
           Now if Qi=0, input equals (2^32-1) and Qo=31+31-0=62. Prepend 
           (62-32=30 zeros) so result is 0.(30 0s)01(30 0s) ~=2^30/2^62 
           = 2^-32 ~= 1/(2^32-1), the reciprocal of the input. 

        2. Input=0x1 gives result=0x7fffffff and scale=0 always. With Qi=0, 
           input equals 1 and Qo=31+0-0=31. The output= (2^31-1)/2^31 ~=1. 
           If Qi=32, then input equals 2^-32 and Qo=31+0-32=-1. 
           Append 1 zero to the right to get result= 0(31 1s)0.0 
           Output=2*(2^31-1) ~= 2^32, same as the reciprocal of the input.


    Input normalization details common to linlut8, cubelut8 and newt:-
      Any 32-bit input can be normalized to the range [.5,1) by trimming the
      leading 0s & interpreting the remaining bits (0-padded to get 32-bits) 
      as a Q32 number. The first 4 bits of the normalized input are used for 
      a rough inverse estimate, which is stored in a LUT with a 3 bit index 
      (MSB=1 always for norm. input). The norm. input range [.5,1) is thus 
      split into 8 segments.


    approx_uinv_linlut8() specific details:-
    The LUT contains the pair (m,c) that satisfy the equation for inverse:

    1/d = c - m*dn
    where,
      d = normalized input in range [.5,1)
      c = inverse of d[31:28] in Q14, treating d[31:28] as a fraction (Q4).
      m = slope of the linear approximation for 1/d in each segment, in Q15.
      dn= d[27:13] in Q15..fraction in range [0,1]

    d:   ||1 |   ind     |  dn     | ignored   ||
         31    30-28(3)  27-13(15)  12-0(13)

    The 'c' entries are skewed to give symmetrical error at either extreme of
    each segment. For e.g. in the 1st row, c=32690 ~= 16/8=32768(Q14)


    Example:
      input: 3.5625 (57 in Q4)
      output: scale=5, result=0x47dd8000=1205698560 (31U result)
              Qo=31+5-4=32 => output =1205698560/2^32 = 0.280724= 1/3.5625


    @return
    A result/scale pair corresponding to 1/input. The result is 31U while 
    the scale is in [0,31]

    @note
    The optimized assembly function is 5 cycles.

    Maximum absolute relative error is 1.8e-3.

  FUNCTION:  approx_uinv_newt

===========================================================================*/
/*!
    @brief
    Approximate unsigned-inverse using Newton-Raphson iterative method.

    @detail
    Given an unsigned input, return an approximation of 1/input, and a scale
    factor.
    The scale factor facilitates a variable input Q-factor.
    If input is 0, the output returned is result=0x7FFFFFFF, scale=0 i.e 0 
    is treated as a 1. Valid input range is 0-0xFFFFFFFF.
    The iteration count must be in [1,3].

    Please refer the common explanations for the input normalization and 
    the output from the approx_uinv_linlut8() prototype details.

    approx_uinv_newt() specific details:-
    Newton's recursive equation for the solution of f(x)=1/x-d is
    x[n+1] =  2*x[n] - d*x[n]^2 where,
      d = normalized input in range [.5,1)
      x[n]= current solution of 1/x -d = 0

    The first approximation for inverse is x[0]=2.9142-2*d, which tracks actual
    inverse 1/d closely, for d in [.5,1).

    Newton's modified iterative solution for 1/d:
    x^2 loses 1 bit compared to x, for e.g x in Q31, x^2 is Q30. d*x^2 loses an
    additional bit as d is Q31. To keep the bit loss to a predictable 1 bit per
    iteration, modify the equation as
    x[n+1]=2*x[n] - d*x[n]*(x[n]<<n).
    With the 2nd term in Q-1, x[n] in Q can be interpreted as 2*x[n] in Q-1
    giving x[n+1] in Q-1, avoiding additional shift operations in the loop.
    Thus, x will be down to Q=31-'iterations' at the end.

    Loop instability:
    If x becomes >=2.0 in a stage (Q is variable in the loop), xp will overflow
    32 bits in the next iteration and the 2nd term becomes negligible compared
    to x. MSBs of x will get stuck at their value and we wont see the expected
    degradation in Q of x. Interpreting this result as Q=Q31-'iterations' is
    then incorrect.
    The solution is to signed saturate the result after a left shift of
    'iterations'-1. This gives the result in Q30, which saturates at 0x7FFFFFFF
    =1.999(Q30) and we get a stable result.


    Example:
      input: 3.5625 (57 in Q4)
      output: scale=5, result=0x47dc11f8=1205604856 (31U result)
              Qo=31+5-4=32 => output =1205604856/2^32 = 0.280702= 1/3.5625

    @return
    A result/scale pair corresponding to 1/input. The result is 31U while 
    the scale is in [0,31].

    @note
    The optimized assembly function is 4+2*(iterations) cycles.

    Maximum absolute relative error : 7.3e-3  6E-5  5.5E-9
                          iterations: 1       2     3
                              cycles: 6       8     10
    Quantization noise makes error worse at more than 3 iterations.

  FUNCTION:  approx_uinv_tylr

===========================================================================*/
/*!
    @brief
    Approximate unsigned-inverse using Taylor's series expansion.

    @detail
    Given an unsigned input and an iteration count, return an approximation of
    1/input, and a scale factor. 
    The iteration count refers to the highest power accumulated in the Taylor 
    series approximation.
    If input is 0, the output returned is result=0xFFFFFFFF, scale=1 .i.e 0 
    is treated as a 1. Valid input range is 0-0xFFFFFFFF.
    The iteration count must be in [3,8].

    Please refer the common explanations for the input normalization and 
    the output from the approx_uinv_linlut8() prototype details. The only 
    difference here is that scale is in [1,32] & the result is a 32U number.

    approx_uinv_tylr() specific details:-
    Taylor's expansion of f(x)=1/(1-x)..|x| < 1:
        f(x)=1+x+x^2+x^3+..ad.inf
        Above is truncated to a fixed length=1+'iterations'. The noise added
        is directly proportional to |x|^(1+'iterations').
    Let a=1-d*x  ..lim a->0
    => d*x = 1-a  OR
    1/d = x/(1-a)
        = x*(1+a+a^2+a^3+..a^hi_pow) where,
      d = normalized input in [.5,1)
      x = init. approx for 1/d,

    Choice of initial approximation:
    The first approximation for inverse is x=2.9142-2*d, as seen in Newton's
    method,  but this gives signed result for a=1-d*x which cannot be
    accomodated in a Q32 unsigned accumulator w/o additional shift operations.
    Hence choose x=2.8283-2*d, which gives unsigned a=1-d*x but at the expense
    of eror symmetry at two extremes of range of d. Hence for symmetric error,
    use x = 2.666 - 1.7778*d,
    which gives same value for a=1-d*x at either extremes .5 and 1


    Example:
      input: 3.5625 (57 in Q4)
      output: scale=6, result=0x8fb8235d=2411209565 (32U result)
              Qo=31+6-4=33 => output =2411209565/2^33 = 0.280702= 1/3.5625
              NOTE: The result is twice the magnitude, compared to other 
              algorithms and so the scale is also 1 more.
    @return
    A result/scale pair corresponding to 1/input. The result is 32U while 
    the scale is in [1,32].

    @note
    The optimized assembly function is 6+(hi_pow) cycles.

    Max absolute relative error: 1.6-4  1.8e-5  2.0e-6  2.5e-7  3.5e-8  3.5e-9
                  highest power: 3      4       5       6       7       8
                         cycles: 9      10      11      12      13      14
    Competitive only for hi_pow=4 but 2 cycles more than ...newt(XX,iter =2) 
    and 3 more than ...cube8lut()
