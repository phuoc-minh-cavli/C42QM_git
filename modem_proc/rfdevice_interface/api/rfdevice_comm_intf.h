when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ------------------------------------------------------------- 
10/13/14   shb     Added overloaded write_to_script API that populates rf script
                   buffer from arrays of addr and data
10/09/14   lm      Made rfdevice_comm_intf derive from rfa to make sure new operator is using
                   modem heap
05/19/14   zhw     Support for reading to RFFE script
10/15/13   jfc     Add stub for rfdevice_common_modify_reg_info
09/27/13   rp      Converted delay prameter to int16 in write_to_script/write_buffered API.
09/23/13   rp      new_time_ref parameter added in write to script api.
09/10/13   rp      Added flush_to_script method.
05/30/13   dps     Initial Revision

  @brief
  Interface communication class that contains all APIs that every RF
  communication class needs to implement.

  @details
  Should not contain any data definitions. Just virtual interface methods that
  each RF communication class needs to implement. All data should be defined
  in derived classes as the type may be different for various protocol types.
 
  Contains pure virtual functions that must be implemented by classes extending
  this communication class.
