  @brief
  A device that can be used for software testing in unit tests and systems
  where no physical hardware components are present.

  @details
  This physical chip implements working stub behavior for any logical
  component that could be present in the RF software system.  It allows
  MC/Core level call flow execution without requring a specific chipset
  assumption, making unit tests and emulation development independent
  of any specific external chipset requirements.
