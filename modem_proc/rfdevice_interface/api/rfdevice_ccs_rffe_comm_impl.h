when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ------------------------------------------------------------- 
10/13/14   shb     Added overloaded write_to_script API that populates rf script
                   buffer from arrays of addr and data
05/19/14   zhw     Support for reading to RFFE script
04/09/14   ndb     Added a flag for Enable/Disable the Multi-byte write in Commclass
02/27/14   yb      Half Rate support for RFFE reads/writes
11/05/13   rp      Code changes to update the extended_cmd flag according to the CCS 
                   implementation.
10/25/13   bmg     Removed unnecessary dependecy on modem hardware specifics
09/27/13   rp      Converted delay prameter to int16 in write_to_script/write_buffered API.
09/23/13   rp      new_time_ref parameter added in script entry holder as well as in
                   write to script API.
08/28/13   rp      Added support for mutibyte write in write to script and 
                   buffered write api.

    Populates rf_buffer_intf* from an array of addr, data, delay

    Optimized implementation of write_to_script that takes an entire array of
