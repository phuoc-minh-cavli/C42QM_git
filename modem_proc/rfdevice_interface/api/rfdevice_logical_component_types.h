when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     -------------------------------------------------------------
10/26/18   up      Added RFDEVICE_THERM_MITIGATIONsupport
11/25/14   vv      Added lna device support
02/11/14   yb      Added coupler device
08/13/13   kg      Change the order in which the devices get initialized 
07/26/13   as      Added new logical devie: RFDEVICE_ASD_TUNER_MANAGER
02/05/13   vb      Added new logical device: RFDEVICE_TUNER_MANAGER
11/26/12   sr      changed the last entry of the enum to 0xFFFFFFFF to force the 
                   compiler to treat the enum as int32 value to support rfc efs data.
