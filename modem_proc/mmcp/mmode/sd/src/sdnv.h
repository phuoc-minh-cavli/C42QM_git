08/15/06   pk      UOOS for GW modifications, added support to read GCF flag
                   from NV
07/15/03   JQ      Added Extended PRL support
                   - D PRL support.
01/25/02   sj      Added support for PUZL - user zone feature.
02/26/01   RC      Changes to support dual-mode targets.

FUNCTION sdnv_init

DESCRIPTION
  Initialize the SD NV-Interface component.

  This function must be called before the NV interface block
  is being used in any way, place or form.

DEPENDENCIES
  This function must be called before any other sdnv_xxx() function is
  ever called.

RETURN VALUE
  none

SIDE EFFECTS
  none

FUNCTION sdnv_write

DESCRIPTION
  Write a SD related item to NV memory.

  Note that the NV write is done in a synchronous fashion. That is, this
  function only returns after the NV task completes the write operation.

DEPENDENCIES
  sdnv_init() must have already been called to initialize the SD NV-Interface
  component.

RETURN VALUE

SIDE EFFECTS

FUNCTION sdnv_read

DESCRIPTION
  Read a SD related item to NV memory.

  function only returns after the NV task completes the read operation.

DEPENDENCIES
  sdnv_init() must have already been called to initialize the SD NV-Interface

RETURN VALUE
  TRUE if NV read operation is successful (or alternatively the NV items is
  being set to a default value). FALSE otherwise.

  None.
