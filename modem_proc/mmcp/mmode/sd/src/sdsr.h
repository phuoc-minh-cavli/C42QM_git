====================== ABSTRACT (ALIST) LIST OPERATORS ======================
=============================================================================
=============================================================================
===========================================================================*/

/*===========================================================================

  Operations on system record lists are implemented using an abstract list
  type called an 'alist' that hides the differences between actual lists and
  system record items.

  When operating on actual lists, the alist ensures that:

  1)  Any code operating on a list will not have the list freed by code on
      another thread while it is executing.  It does this by implementing lists
      as reference-counted objects.
  2)  A list will not be altered while code is operating on it - from the
      code's standpoint, the list is immutable.  It does this by enforcing
      copy-on-write semantics on the underlying list object.  This means that
      any changes will occur on a copy of the list and then be stored back
      into the lists array when done; code already operating on the list will
      (because the list is reference-counted) continue operating on the old
      copy of the list.

  Typical use of an alist is:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  sdsr_alist  alist;              // declare the alist

  sdsr_alist_init(&alist, list);  // initialize alist with the list you want
                                  //  to operate on

  sdsr_alist_xxxx(&alist, ...);   // do alist operations

  sdsr_alist_store_and_release(&alist); // store any changes and release
                                        //  the underlying list
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=============================================================================*/


/*=============================================================================
sdsr_alist

  This is the "abstract list" object that is used to operate on lists and items
  uniformly.  It has "copy on write" semantics for lists; reads, etc. on an
  alist work against the list stored in the list array, but when a _put, _del,
  _clear, or _clone is done a copy is made.
