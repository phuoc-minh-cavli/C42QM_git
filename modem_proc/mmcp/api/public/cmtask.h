01/18/02   ic      Merged MSM_CM.05.03.33 on top of tip CCS CM
                   Diffed MSM_CM.05.03.32 with MSM_CM.05.03.33 and only the changes
                   between those two were merged with CCS CM
12/13/01   ic      Merged MSM_CM.05.03.32 onto SVD CM tip.
                   CCS CM code started from CM VU MSM_CM.05.03.25 + WCDMA/GSM
                   stuff from SIMBA team merged on top of it.
                   We diff'ed MSM_CM.05.03.25 with MSM_CM.05.03.32 (CM VU in N*2165)
                   that we needed to merge with and changes between those two VUs
                   were merged onto CCS CM tip.
