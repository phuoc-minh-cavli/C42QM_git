when       who      what, where, why
--------   ---      ---------------------------------------------------------
04/13/11   rm       Moving LOG_CM_CALL_EVENT_C to cmlog.h 
05/06/10   rm      Make srv_status sent to Diag consistent with what is sent
                   in ss event 
05/07/09   sv      Correct lint error
02/02/09   ks      Adding support for QDSP 6 based compiler
01/29/09   fj      Remove FEATURE_HDR_HYBRID for call events
03/17/08   am      Added two diag commands to support 
                   commands for CM_CALL_CMD_MODIFY_REQ / RSP
01/03/08   ka      Adding handset based plus code dialing feature.
04/15/07   rp       Removing FEATURE_MMGPS
11/17/06   jqi     Added support for HDR active protocol revision information.
11/09/06   rp      Added support for SS req/response packet
                   CM_GET_CELL_SERVICE_IND.
04/19/06   jqi     Added diag subsystem command(select system preference 
                   command2) to process 64-bit band preference. 
03/10/06   pk       Added support for IMSI and MCC for IS 95 systems. Changed
                    the changed fields of the ss log packet to 64 bits
01/05/06   pk       Modified the SS log packet structure. Replaced constants
                    with hard coded values, repalced boolean with uint8
