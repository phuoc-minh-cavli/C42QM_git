when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
7/12/01     CD     Initial version.  Transferred mn_uasms data from mn.h
08/16/01    AB     Renamed MMI references to CM.

9/27/01     CD     Deleted tp_message_reference from SM_RL_DATA_REQ_T
                   Deleted tp_smi, and sm_rl_success from SM_RL_REPORT_IND_T
                   Changed error_type to error_status in SM_RL_REPORT_IND_T
                   Changed type of RP_OA in SM_RL_DATA_IND_T to cm_called_party_bcd_no_T

                   Added definitions for error_status in SM_RL_REPORT_IND_T

9/28/01     CD     Added definition for RP_USER_DATA_LENGTH, changed TPDU dimension
                   in SM_RL_REPORT_IND_T from TPDU_SIZE to RP_USER_DATA_LENGTH

                   Changed TPDU_SIZE to 164

1/29/02     RG     Changed the short_message_identifier in the SM_RL_DATA_REQ message 
                   to be a 'word' instead of a 'byte'.  Added "word short_message_identifier" 
                   to the SM_RL_MEMORY_AVAILABILITY_REQ_T structure.  Changed the 
                   short_message_identifier in the SM_RL_REPORT_IND message to be a 
                   'word' instead of a 'byte'.  The above changes were done to give the 
                   UASMS the ability to correlate the memory availability requests 
                   with the corresponding reponses.

6/17/02     RG     Defined the base value ( MN_WMS_MT_MESSAGE_IDENTIFIER_BASE )
                   that is added to the SMS connection id and sent in 
                   SM_RL_REPORT_IND.short_message_identifier from MN to WMS during
                   MN layer and lower layer failures in an MT SMS.

16/02/06    NR     Adding new reject cause for handling CNM MO SMS timer expiry

04/09/07    RD     SMS optimization changes are incorporated
