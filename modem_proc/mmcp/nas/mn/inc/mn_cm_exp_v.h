08/16/01   AB      Renamed MMI references to CM.

01/25/02   CD      Modified structures per new CM-to-MN interface. Replaced IEI
                   fields by boolean flag the indicates if the IE is present or not

                   Moved contents of mn_exp.h here

02/11/02   AB      Added CM_CLIR_DEFAULT and CM_CAUSE_DEFAULT default value so 
                   that CM can use to set the appropriate default value for

                     allowed in MPTY.

03/02/02   AB      Increased number of ForwardToNumber to array of  
                     MAXNO_FORWARD_TO_NUMBER, 0x9, in forwardToFeatureList 
                     structure. 

03/12/02   AB      Added cm_cc_invoke_T to contains the directory number 
                     to support CD.

                   Added ie_name_indicator_T, ie_ect_indicator_T, ie_ccbs_feature_T
                     and the ie_multicall_indicator_T to completed the 
                     cm_notifySS_T message structure.

01-Apr-2002  VT    GSM EFR: Added octets 3a, 3b, and 3c of type, 
                     gsm_speech_ver_e_type, in cm_bearer_capability_T, 
                     inside FEATURE_GSM_EFR.
               GSM EFR: In the definition of cm_bearer_capability_T,
                     added comment for octets 3a, 3b, and 3c:  We'll 

                   GSM EFR: Introduced the definition of gsm_speech_ver_e_type
                     inside #ifdef FEATURE_GSM_EFR.
                   GSM EFR: Introduced the definition of 
                     gsm_coding_bearer_cap_octet3x_e_type inside 
                     #ifdef FEATURE_GSM_EFR.
                   Actually, merged all the above changes from rev 1.11.1.1
                     (a branch) of this file.

08-Apr-2002  AB    Delete the NEW_CONNECTION_ID liternal as no longer needed

07/29/02     AB    Moved the notification description here from

                   having to includes other MN header files.

                   Added CNAP SS code, extracted from UMTS TS29.02 spec.

08/08/02    AB     Set the MAXNO_FORWARD_TO_NUMBER to 9 as specified
                   in UMTS TS24.080 spec.- now that CM/UI can handle  
                   larger command buffer size. 

08/14/02    AB     Reset the MAXNO_FOwARD_TO_NUMBER to 2 because
                   of stability issue with larger command buffer
                   size at the CM/UI.

09/16/02    AB     Removed FEATURE_GSM_EFR, code exclusion by 
                   definition.

11/26/02    AB     Added the multimedia other rate adaption.
 
04/09/03    AB     Added ie_cm_cc_rej_T that use supports silent

06/02/03    AB     Reduce the MAXNO_FORWARD_TO_NUMBER further to 1 from 2 to 
                      save data memory as UI/CM only use 1 entry.

07/02/02    AB     Added call back servcies of CS handover notification 
                      and CM/UI AOC response.

07/25/03    AB     Updated the InterrogateSS_Res_T fix overlap of ss_status
                      and BSG data.  CR#33317.

02/24/05    AB     Added ATCOP client for HO notification.

03/07/05    HS     Added supports for FEATURE_TTY (CTM bit).

04/19/05    HS     Added support for FEATURE_CCBS

06/12/05    AB     Increase the added location estimate to 91 from 90 per
                       TS23.032, encoding of the polygon shape. 

11/09/05    AB     Added supports for FEATURE_EMERGENCY_CATEGORY

04/10/06    NR     Adding HTORPC metacomments to the remote CM APIs

05/02/06    NR     Correcting numberOfPW_AttemptsViolation SS error code

07/11/06    NR     Adding FEATURE_HTORPC_METACOMMENTS for remote_api working.

07/27/06    NR     Modifying the remote_api comments for removing error fatal

09/14/06    NR     Adding changes for passing raw byte stream to CATAPPS
