when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
24-Oct-2001  VT    DTMF: Added enum cc_dtmf_state_e_type
26-Oct-2001  VT    DTMF: Removed #define U10_DTMF ( 10+ 0x80 )
29-Oct-2001  AB    SS:  Moved SS state defiens to cc_state_T location
                        nas_exp.h.  The cc_state_T was from byte to enum
                        type for code security.
01-Nov-2001  AB    SS: Moved ss_state_T and cc_state_T here from nas_exp.h
                       for coherent purpose.
08/01/02     CD    Removed SMS_CONN_REESTABLISH definition since it is not used

05/10/05     HS    Added support for FEATURE_CCBS
