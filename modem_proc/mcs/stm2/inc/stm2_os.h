  @brief
  This file contains variant source particular to a given operating system
  or target whose services are needed by the STM framework.

  @detail
  The STM framework needs several operating system specific constructs that
  are to be provided in this file.  Namely, they are as follows:

  - A generic error reporting mechanism.  Normally, STM relies upon the
    error function pointer in the state machine instance for error reporting,
    but needs a generic fallback mechanism to report errors in the case that
    the state machine instance pointer is NULL.
  - A generic critical section mechanism.  STM needs a critical section entry
    and exit construct such that it can perform thread-safe synchronization
    and locking on the STM data structures when in-use.
