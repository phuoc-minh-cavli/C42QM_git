                STM_BM.H   STM Buffer Management Subsystem Header

Description:
  This module contains the functions needed to create a pool of buffers and
  to allocate and deallocate the buffers and manage the pool.  A pool consists
  of a pre-determined maximum number of buffer lists each containing buffers
  of a different size.

  An example of how to use this follows:

    #define MAX_SIZES  2     maximum number of different buffer sizes
    #define BUF1_SIZE  16    number of data bytes in buffer list 1 buffers  
    #define BUF1_CNT   5     number of buffers in buffer list 1
    #define BUF2_SIZE  80    number of data bytes in buffer list 2 buffers
    #define BUF2_CNT   3     number of buffers in buffer list 2

    stm_bm_handle handle;    handle for calls to stm_bm_ functions for this pool 

    stm_bm_list_type node_mem[MAX_SIZES];    memory for buffer list nodes

  To declare memory for the buffers themselves use this method:

    uint8 buf1_mem[STM_BM_BUF_MEM_SIZE(BUF1_SIZE, BUF1_CNT)];

  or this method:

    struct
    {
      stm_bm_hdr_type hdr;
      uint8           buf[BUF2_SIZE];
    }
    buf2_mem[BUF2_CNT];

  To create an instance of STM_BM and add buffer lists to it:

    handle = stm_bm_create( MAX_SIZES, node_mem );
    stm_bm_add_buffer_list( handle, BUF1_SIZE, BUF1_CNT, buf1_mem );
    stm_bm_add_buffer_list( handle, BUF2_SIZE, BUF2_CNT, buf2_mem );

  To allocate and deallocate buffers:

    buf_p = stm_bm_get_buffer( handle, BUF1_SIZE );
    stm_bm_return_buffer( handle, buf_p );

  Buffers can be added to an existing buffer list via stm_bm_add_buffer_list()
  with the same buffer size as an existing buffer list.  Newbuffer lists can be
  added at any time provided that there at most MAX_SIZES differnet buffer
  sizes.  A buffer list can be deleted by calling stm_bm_remove_buffer_list().

  Although STM_BM is similar to malloc() and free(), it cannot be fragmented and
  the address of each buffer can be calculated from the base address of the
  buffer list memory which is in the memory map.

Externalized Functions:
  stm_bm_create
  stm_bm_add_buffer_list
  stm_bm_remove_buffer_list
  stm_bm_get_buffer
  stm_bm_return_buffer

Initialization and Sequencing Requirements:
  stm_bm_create() must be called first

FUNCTION STM_BM_CREATE

DESCRIPTION    Creates the list nodes linked list using list_mem.   max_lists
               is the maximum number of different buffer sizes allowed.  The
               returned handle is a pointer to the first node in the list of
               buffer lists.
               
DEPENDENCIES   list must point to a memory area that is at least
               (sizeof(stm_bm_list_type) * max_lists) bytes.

RETURN VALUE   A handle if parameters are valid, NULL if not

FUNCTION STM_BM_ADD_BUFFER_LIST

DESCRIPTION    Adds a list of buffers.  If the buffers are the same size as an
               existing list, the buffers are appended to that list.  Otherwise
               an unused buffer list node is found and populated with the new
               buffer list.  The buffer lists are maintained in ascending order
               by buffer size thus it is fastest if buffer lists are added in
               this order (but not required).
               
DEPENDENCIES   There must be an unused buffer list node unless the buffers are
               the same size as an existing list

               amd moving it to the end of the node list.
