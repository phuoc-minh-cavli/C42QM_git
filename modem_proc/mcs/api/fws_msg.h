/*! @brief Application configuration command message.

    "Enabling" an application refers to initializing a technology-specific
    FW module to a state where it can respond to SW commands through its own 
    interface, e.g. registering its messages, or mapping a shared memory buffer. 
    Once a configuration response has been received, SW may then issue further 
    commands through the application-specific interface.

    "Disabling" an application will free up any owned resources, including
    its SW interface. A disabled application will not respond to any 
    application-specific commands.

    This message specifies zero or more FW applications to disable,
    and zero or more FW applications to enable.
    All of the application disables are performed before any of the 
    enables.

    A MCS_FWS_APP_CONFIG_RSP message is returned once all the enables and 
    disables have completed, and contains the updated mask of enabled applications.
    @see fw_app_config_rsp_t

    If the disable mask specifies an application that has already been 
    disabled, or the enable mask specifies an application that has already
    been enabled, then that application will be silently ignored.
    If either mask specifies an application that does not exist in the image,
    then an error status is returned.
    If an application fails enable or disable (for example, if resources
    are not available), then its status will not change and an error status
    will be returned. 

    e.g.
    disable_mask = FW_APP_NONE; enable_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X;
    - enables the CDMA1X FW application
    disable_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X; enable_mask = FW_APP_HDR | FW_APP_C2KSRCH
    - disables the CDMA1X FW application, then enables the HDR and C2KSRCH
      applications

/*! @brief Application configuration response message.

    This message is always sent in response to a MCS_FWS_APP_CONFIG_CMD
    message.

    The enabled_mask field reflects all the currently enabled applications, after
    applying the disable/enable commands. Note that this includes applications
    that were previously enabled, not just the ones in the most recent command.

    The error_mask bitmask is non-zero for any technology which caused an error,
    either because it was not present, or because it returned an error status
    during enable/disable (if resources were not available, for example).

    The bitmask of applications present in the image and which are currently
    enabled is also available through the FWS shared-memory interface.
    @see fw_app_smem_intf_t

    SW should treat any error response as a serious error, indicating that 
    there is a mismatch between SW/FW (SW trying to enable an app that is 
    not present), or a configuration is not valid (an app fails disable because
    it is still in traffic mode, for example).

    e.g.
    Command: disable_mask = FW_APP_NONE; enable_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X;
    Response: enabled_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X; error_mask = FW_APP_NONE;
    - CDMA1X application was successfully enabled, no errors
    Command: disable_mask = FW_APP_NONE; enable_mask = FW_APP_HDR | FW_APP_C2KSRCH
    Response: enabled_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X | FW_APP_C2KSRCH; error_mask = FW_APP_HDR;
    - C2KSRCH successfully was enabled, HDR is either not present or generated
      an error condition during enable. CDMA1X was previously enabled, and 
      remains enabled.
    Command: disable_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X; enable_mask = FW_APP_NONE;
    Response: enabled_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X | FW_APP_C2KSRCH; error_mask = FW_APP_CDMA1X;
    - CDMA1X generated an error when trying to disable. It remains in the bitmask
      of enabled applications.
