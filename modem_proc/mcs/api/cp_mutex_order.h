/*=============================================================================
  The following enum defines the order in which control-plane mutexes must
  be entered.  By following this ordering, we can prevent deadlock due to
  different threads entering mutexes in different orders.  The technique used
  is called "lock leveling"; for some references, see

  The control-plane mutex tracking code assigns a unique order to each mutex,
  rather than the shared "levels" in the above references.

  In the enum below, mutexes with lower order (nearer the top of the enum) must
  be entered before mutexes with higher order (nearer the bottom of the enum).
  In general, the "closer" a mutex is to the UI the lower its order should be.
  Mutexes acquired immediately upon entry to external APIs should come nearer
  the top of this enum, those used internally should come further down, and
  those used by low-level system functions should come nearer the bottom.

  Ordering of mutexes must be done system-wide, as calling another task's API
  may lead to a mutex being acquired in that task, and it may call yet other
  tasks.  That being said, there's no need to spend a lot of time trying to
  figure out ordering until an error message in the logs indicates that there
  is a problem - at present we expect the mutex tree to be fairly flat and not
  to have many cross-task acquisitions.
