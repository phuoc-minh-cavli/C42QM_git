                STM.H - State Machine  Header File

DESCRIPTION
  This file contains the state machine structures necessary for STM
  operation.

  STM is a framework that automates the generation of a group of state machines.
  A BNF grammar is used to specify the state machine group and the individual
  state machines and states themselves.  During compilation, a state machine
  compiler (smcomp.pl) generates the tables and definitions that describe (in C)
  the specified state machine group construct.

  A state machine group can contain an arbitrary number of concurrently active
  state machines.  Each state machine can contain an arbitrary number of states,
  of which only one is the current state.

  State machines are input driven.  Inputs may be any arbitrary command sent to
  a given state machine.  In the STM grammar, for each state in a state machine,
  a series of inputs are mapped to transition functions.  Also for each state
  there may be entry and/or exit functions specified.  When an input is received
  by a state machine, the transition function for the current state is called.
  The transition function then returns the next state the state machine should
  enter.  If the next state is different than the current state, the exit
  function of the current state is called prior to the entry function for the
  next state.  State machines themselves also have an entry and/or exit
  function.  Upon being started, a state machine's entry function is called.
  Upon being stopped, a state machine's exit function is called.  Similarly,
  state machine groups have an entry and/or exit function.  When a state machine
  group is started, the entry function is called.  When it is stopped, the exit
  function is called.

  State machine groups are composed of one or more state machines.  Each group
  may optionally have an internal command queue that is used to communicate
  between state machines.  There can be an entry and exit function for each
  state machine group and for each state machine.  State machines within an
  active state machine group may be individually activated and deactivated.

  stm_start_group() is used to start a group of state machines.  State machines
  within the group may be started as active or inactive.  Once the group is
  started, the user may optionally call stm_activate() or stm_deactivate() to
  activate or deactivate individual state machines within the group.
  stm_activate() allows the user to start the state machine in its last state or
  in it's initial state.  State machines may also call stm_put_internal_cmd() to
  send internal commands to each other. stm_stop_group() is called to deactivate
  the group and all state machines within the group.

  STATE_MACHINE_TYPE

    The state machine type contains all the relevant information about

    machine operations.

    The active flag is used to route a given signal to a set of
    state machines. Because a signal does not have a destination and
    because it is advantageous to be able to "route" a signal to more
    than one state machine at different times, we need to identify
    which of those state machines will be responsible for processing the
    signal.

    Ideally the group should be set to inactive after executing the exit
    functions of all the state machines and states of the group and not when
    stm_stop_group() is called. Otherwise, the following might happen.
    a) a function called by an exit function might return/print an error since
       group is inactive or
    b) a callback function that is cancelled by an exit function might now run
       and return/print an error since group is inactive.

    So a new boolean 'stopped' was added to control the stm_driver.
    It is set when stm_stop_group() is called and this stops the driver.
    The 'active' boolean is reset only after calling the exit functions
    in stop_group().

    When a group does not use stm driver, we need a way to call stop_group()
    after stm_stop_group() is called. Note that this cannot be done from within
    stm_stop_group() since the call to stm_stop_group() can occur in the
    middle of a transition function. So stop_group() is called from
    stm_process_group(). The boolean 'using_driver' is used to remember how
    the group was started.
