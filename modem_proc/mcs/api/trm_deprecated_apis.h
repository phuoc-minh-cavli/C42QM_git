FUNCTION TRM_GET_SIMULT_CAP
 TRM get simultaneous capability

DESCRIPTION
  This api will return a 8 bit value where
  Bit 0 = 1 indicates SHDR is enabled.  
  Bit 1 = 1 indicates SVDO is enabled.
  Bit 2 = 1 indicates SVLTE is enabled 
  Bit 3 = 1 is reserved.
  Bit 4 = 1 indicates DSDA is enabled 
  Bit 5 = 1 indicates SGLTE and SGTDS are enabled 

  If SVDO bit(bit 1) is set, then the SHDR bit(bit 0) should be treated as
  ‘don’t care’. Following macros can be used to identify the bits :
   TRM_SHDR_IS_ENABLED        (0x01)
   TRM_SVDO_IS_ENABLED        (0x02)
   TRM_SVLTE_IS_ENABLED       (0x04)
   TRM_SVLTE_IS_DSDA          (0x10)
   TRM_SGLTE_SGTDS_IS_ENABLED (0x20)
   
  Note: Value 0x8 is reserved.

FUNCTION TRM_FREQ_REQUEST

DESCRIPTION
  Specifies the given client needs the given transciever resource, for the
  given duration, for the supplied reason.

  The resource request is immediately evaluated, and the result returned.

  This may be used in conjunction with trm_reserve_at(). This is different to
  old api since it takes band as an argument. This is used to check if the
  band is valid and also if components mapped to the band don't have any
  concurrency issues.
  
DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  TRM_DENIED          - the client was denied the transceiver resources.
  TRM_GRANTED_CHAIN0  - the client can now use the primary RF chain.
  TRM_GRANTED_CHAIN1  - the client can now use the secondary RF chain.

SIDE EFFECTS
  If the client currently holds an RF chain, that chain is released before
  the request is evaluated.

FUNCTION TRM_CHANGE_PRIORITY

DESCRIPTION
  When a client changes what it is doing, it should change the advertised
  reason for holding the transceiver resource, so its priority will change.

  Eg) A client request the transceiver resource for listening for a PAGE.  If
  it receives one, it would change its priority to PAGE_RESPONSE and attempt
  to respond to the page, and eventually change its priority to TRAFFIC.

  The client must be holding a transceiver resource lock

FUNCTION TRM_FREQ_RESERVE_AT

DESCRIPTION
  Specifies the given client needs the given transceiver resource at the given
  time, for the given duration, for the supplied reason. This is different to
  old api since it takes band as an argument. This is used to check if the
  band is valid and also if components mapped to the band don't have any
  concurrency issues.
