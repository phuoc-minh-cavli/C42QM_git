   Dr B. R. Gladman <brg@gladman.uk.net> 1st June 2001.

   This is an implementation of the AES encryption algorithm (Rijndael)
   designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. This version is designed
   to provide both fixed and dynamic block and key lengths and can also 
   run with either big or little endian internal byte order.
    
   NOTE: Input block and key lengths are given in terms of the lengths of
   the byte arrays involved, the legal values being 16, 24 and 32.

   A. THE CIPHER INTERFACE

   byte                    (an unsigned 8-bit type)
   word                    (an unsigned 32-bit type)
   aes_ret:                (a signed 16 bit type for function return values)
        aes_good            (value != 0, a good return)
        aes_bad             (value == 0, an error return)
   enum aes_key:           (encryption direction)
        enc                 (set key for encryption)
        dec                 (set key for decryption)
        both                (set key for both)
   class or struct aes     (structure for context)

   C subroutine calls:

   aes_ret set_blk(const word block_length, aes *cx)  (variable block size)
   aes_ret set_key(const byte key[], const word key_length,
				   const enum aes_key direction, aes *cx)
   aes_ret encrypt(const byte input_blk[], byte output_blk[], const aes *cx)
   aes_ret decrypt(const byte input_blk[], byte output_blk[], const aes *cx)

   IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are using this C interface and your compiler does 
   not set the memory used for objects to zero before use, you will need to 
   ensure that cx.mode is set to zero before using the C subroutine calls.

   C++ aes class subroutines:

   aes_ret set_blk(const word block_length)  (variable block size)
   aes_ret set_key(const byte key[], const word key_length,
				   const aes_key direction)
   aes_ret encrypt(const byte input_blk[], byte output_blk[]) const
   aes_ret decrypt(const byte input_blk[], byte output_blk[]) const

   The block length inputs to set_block and set_key are in numbers of
   BYTES, not bits.  The calls to subroutines must be made in the above 
   order but multiple calls can be made without repeating earlier calls
   if their parameters have not changed. If the cipher block length is
   variable but set_blk has not been called before cipher operations a
   value of 16 is assumed (that is, the AES block size). In contrast to 
   earlier versions the block and key length parameters are now checked
   for correctness and the encryption and decryption routines check to 
   ensure that an appropriate key has been set before they are called.
   
   B. BYTE ORDER WITHIN 32 BIT WORDS

   The fundamental data processing units in Rijndael are 8-bit bytes. The 
   input, the output and the key input are all enumerated arrays of bytes 
   in which bytes are numbered starting at zero and increasing to one less
   than the number of bytes in the array in question.  When these inputs 
   and outputs are considered as bit sequences, the n'th byte contains 
   bits 8n to 8n+7 of the sequence with the lower numbered bit mapped to 
   the most significant bit within the  byte (i.e. that having a numeric 
   value of 128).  However, Rijndael can be implemented more efficiently 
   using 32-bit words to process 4 bytes at a time provided that the order
   of bytes within words is known.  This order is called big-endian if the 
   lowest numbered bytes in words have the highest numeric significance 
   and little-endian if the opposite applies. This code can work in either 
   order irrespective of the native order of the machine on which it runs.
   The byte order used internally is set by defining INTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER
   whereas the order for all inputs and outputs is specified by defining 
   EXTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER, the only purpose of the latter being to determine
   if a byte order change is needed immediately after input and immediately
   before output to account for the use of a different internal byte order.  
   In almost all situations both of these defines will be set to the native 
   order of the processor on which the code is to run but other settings 
   may somtimes be useful in special circumstances.

#define INTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER LITTLE_ENDIAN
#define EXTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER LITTLE_ENDIAN

   C. COMPILATION 

   To compile AES (Rijndael) for use in C code
    a. Exclude the AES_DLL define in aes.h
    b. Exclude the AES_IN_CPP define in aes.h

   To compile AES (Rijndael) for use in in C++ code
    a. Exclude the AES_DLL define in aes.h
    b. Include the AES_IN_CPP define in aes.h

   To compile AES (Rijndael) in C as a Dynamic Link Library
    a. Include the AES_DLL define in aes.h
    b. Compile the DLL.  If using the test files, exclude aes.c from
       the test build project and compile it with the same defines 
       as used for the DLL (ensure that the DLL path is correct)

   D. CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (see also aes.c)

   1. define BLOCK_SIZE to set the cipher block size (16, 24 or 32) or
      leave this undefined for dynamically variable block size (this will
      result in much slower code).
   2. set AES_IN_CPP to use the code from C++ rather than C
   3. set AES_DLL if AES (Rijndael) is to be compiled to a DLL
   4. set INTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER to one of the above constants to set the
      internal byte order (the order used within the algorithm code)
   5. set EXTERNAL_BYTE_ORDER to one of the above constants to set the byte
      order used at the external interfaces for the input, output and key
      byte arrays.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: BLOCK_SIZE is in BYTES: 16, 24, 32 or undefined for aes.c
   and 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 or undefined for aes++.c.  If left undefined a 
   slower version providing variable block length is compiled   

#define BLOCK_SIZE  16

   Define AES_IN_CPP if you intend to use the AES C++ class rather than the
   C code directly.

#define AES_IN_CPP

   Define AES_DLL if you wish to compile the code to produce a Windows DLL

#define AES_DLL

   The AES algorithm Rijndael implemented for block and key sizes of 128,
   192 and 256 bits (16, 24 and 32 bytes) by Brian Gladman.

   I retain copyright in this code but I encourage its free use provided
   that I don't carry any responsibility for the results. I am especially 
   happy to see it used in free and open source software. If you do use 
   it I would appreciate an acknowledgement of its origin in the code or
   the product that results and I would also appreciate knowing a liitle
   about the use to which it is being put. I am grateful to Frank Yellin
   for some ideas that are used in this implementation.
 
   Dr B. R. Gladman <brg@gladman.uk.net> 1st June 2001.
 
   This is an implementation of the AES encryption algorithm (Rijndael)
   designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. This version is designed
   to provide both fixed and dynamic block and key lengths and can also 
   run with either big or little endian internal byte order (see aes.h). 
   It inputs block and key lengths in bytes with the legal values being 
   16, 24 and 32.
 
   CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (see also aes.h)
 
   1.  Define UNROLL for full loop unrolling in encryption and decryption.
   2.  Define PARTIAL_UNROLL to unroll two loops in encryption and decryption.
   3.  Define FIXED_TABLES for compiled rather than dynamic tables.
   4.  Define FF_TABLES to use tables for field multiplies and inverses.
   5.  Define ARRAYS to use arrays to hold the local state block. If this
       is not defined, individually declared 32-bit words are used.
   6.  Define FAST_VARIABLE if a high speed variable block implementation
       is needed (essentially three separate fixed block size code sequences)
   7.  Define either ONE_TABLE or FOUR_TABLES for a fast table driven 
       version using 1 table (2 kbytes of table space) or 4 tables (8
       kbytes of table space) for higher speed.
   8.  Define either ONE_LR_TABLE or FOUR_LR_TABLES for a further speed 
       increase by using tables for the last rounds but with more table
       space (2 or 8 kbytes extra).
   9.  If neither ONE_TABLE nor FOUR_TABLES is defined, a compact but 
       slower version is provided.
   10. If fast decryption key scheduling is needed define ONE_IM_TABLE
       or FOUR_IM_TABLES for higher speed (2 or 8 kbytes extra).

   USE OF DEFINES
  
   NOTE: some combinations of the following defines are disabled below.

   UNROLL or PARTIAL_UNROLL control the extent to which loops are unrolled
   in the main encryption and decryption routines. UNROLL does a complete
   unroll while PARTIAL_UNROLL uses a loop with two rounds in it.
 
#define UNROLL
#define PARTIAL_UNROLL
 
   If FIXED_TABLES is defined, the tables are comipled statically into the 
   code, otherwise they are computed once when the code is first used.
 
#define FIXED_TABLES
 
   If FF_TABLES is defined faster finite field arithmetic is performed by 
   using tables.
 
#define FF_TABLES

   If ARRAYS is defined the state variables for encryption are defined as
   arrays, otherwise they are defined as individual variables. The latter
   is useful on machines where these variables can be mapped to registers. 
 
#define ARRAYS

   If FAST_VARIABLE is defined with variable block length, faster but larger
   code is used for encryption and decryption.

#define FAST_VARIABLE
