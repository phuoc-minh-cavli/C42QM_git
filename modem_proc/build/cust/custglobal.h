/* This file is autogenerated from the FEATURE database
 * This file separates the global build configuration from local SU configuration.
 * Most #defines in cust files are only used with the subystem that owns the cust file,
 * yet all the cust files were being included by everyone via the auto-generated cust file.
 * e.g. custaaaaanaaq.h for MSM8960.  Now the auto-generated cust file only includes this file.
 * The features defined here have been deleted from the individual cust files, and those cust
 * files are now only included from within the SU that owns them i.e. they are no longer global

/* Features that are global for 4.x but local for Dime still need to be defined
 * globally to allow for components to be used for both i.e. if the feature is 
 * global for 4.x it will not be defined in the <su>_local_defines.h file for SU
 * in 4.x so if that component is used for dime the feature would never be defined.

/* Until CoreBSP changes all of their files to include core_variation.h, we must

 * by CoreBSP that were previously in other people's cust files or the .builds file
 * are not defined in custglobal.h */
