/*! @brief
 * 8 LTE LL1 Serving Cell Frame Timing (Log code ID: 0xB114)
 *
 *  This log packet provides information about downlink and uplink timing. When 
 *  enabled, the log record is generated at least once every 20 subframes.  If 
 *  change in frame timing is outside of the timing adjustment range,  a new 
 *  log is generated.
