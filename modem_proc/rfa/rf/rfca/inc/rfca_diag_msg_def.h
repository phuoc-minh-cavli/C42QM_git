	REQ_RESP Model 1

	This model represents a case where HAL request is responded with two response packages.
	The first response is just an acknowledgment indicating that a delayed reponse will be sent later.
	The second reponse is the delayed reponse which will contain the actual HAL reponse data.
	This request-response sequence is used for all HAL commands that queue messages to FTM sequencer, like HAL_RF_RX_WAIT_REQ.

	REQ_RESP Model 2

	This model represents scenario where HAL request is responded with only one response package.
	The first and only response is both an acknowledgment and a data reponse and contains the actual HAL reponse data.
	This request-response sequence is used for all HAL commands that do NOT queue messages to FTM sequencer, like HAL_RF_INIT.
