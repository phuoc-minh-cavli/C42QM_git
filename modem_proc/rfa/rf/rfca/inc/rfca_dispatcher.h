  @brief
  Dispatches DIAG messages coming from HAL and FTM to the RFCA layer. Incoming DIAG requests 
  from AP or PC-HAL are sent to appropriate '_send' function to be processed.

  During the FTM sequencer execution FTM log messages are coming back and are captured
  by RfcaRespDispatcher function. Once all responses to all FTM messages sent from '_send'
  function have been received a callback,if one is defined, is called. Once callback returns
  a DIAG response message

 @details When a valid response has been recevied the response data is copied to 
          FTM package in the RFCA queue item. If all expected FTM responses have
          been recived then the callback function is called. After callback
          returns the DIAG response is sent back to the caller and item is removed
          from the RFCA queue.

 @see RfcaCommandQueue, FtmResponseCallback
