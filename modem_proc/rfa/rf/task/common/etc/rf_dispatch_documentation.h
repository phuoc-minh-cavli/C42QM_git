  @mainpage RF Dispatch
 
  @details
  This module provides a common framework to perform generic command
  dispatching for tasks used by RF Software. This module also provides an
  feature to perform secondary dispatching after main dispatch. Secondary
  Dispatching allows introducing command specific dispatch feature. For
  instance, a sequence number based secondary dispatch can be used by any
  command to perform synchronization of messaging between RF and FW.
 
  <b> RF Dispatch Module does not hold any data pertaining to each task. It
  will be the responsibility of the task to store the dispatch data. This
  dispatch data will be pushed to the RF Dispatch module as dispatch handler,
  on which the RF dispatch module will perform the dispatching algorithm.</b>

  @defgroup RF_DISPATCH Primary Dispatch
  @details
  This module handles the first level of command dispatching. All
  registsred commands are grouped together based on the tech (8 MSB of command
  ID) and stored in several nodes of a linked list; where each each corresponds
  to a tech. Each registered command is allocated a opaque data container to
  store data pertaining to secondary dispatch. This allows to have different
  kinds of second level dispatching for each command in same linked list 
  node.

    @defgroup RF_DISPATCH_SECONDARY_SNUM Sequence Number
    @brief
    This module pertains to secondary dispatching based on sequence number.
    The priamry use of this is for RF and FW message synchronization. The basic
    working principal is that RF will generate a unique sequence number and send
    it to FW embedded in the message. RF will register a callback function
    with the dispatcher based on the same sequence number. FW loops back the
    sequence number. Once the command from FW is received by the dispatcher, it
    get get routed to the sequence number based callback via main dispatch
    and sequence number based secondary dispatcher. The callback function
    for the sequence number can be registered as dynamic registration 
    (registered everytime before sending command to FW) or static registration
    (register once).
