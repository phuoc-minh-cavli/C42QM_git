$Header: //components/rel/rfa.mpss/3.10/rf/common/hwtc/inc/ftm_hwtc_cmd.h#1 $

when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
05/17/11   rsr/sr  Fix for env gain length in HWTC.  uint8 ->uint16
05/13/11   sar     Added ftmicap.h.
10/28/09   aro     Featurized Tech Specifc Code
09/25/09   aro     Fixed "PACKED" usage to be compatible with QDSP6
09/16/09   bmg     Added target.h hack after comdef.h because SCMM comdef.h
                   is broken for off-target builds
09/01/09   tnt     Move INO code from hwtc to ftm
08/20/09   tnt     Add code for common ino
07/27/09   rsr     Fixes to add HWTC command from Linear. Debug tools 
06/26/09   bmg     Fixed MSVC packing pragma to restore the previous value
                   before leaving the header file.
10/31/08   bmg     Fixed off-target packing pragmas
10/18/07   dw      Added ftm_hwtc_c0_c1_delay_type.
10/02/06   ka      Added ftm_hwtc_filter_coeff_type.
09/02/04   lcl     Added ftm_mix_type to the union.
01/18/03   ra     Initial revision.Baseline from FTM CMD header
