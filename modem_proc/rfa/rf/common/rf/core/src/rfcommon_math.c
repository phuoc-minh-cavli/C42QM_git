  @brief
  Compute y=f(x) where f(x) is a piecewise-linear function described by
  a table of x and y coordinates, using linear interpolation between
  known points.

  @details
  This function computes
  ((Y[i] - Y[i-1])/(X[i] - X[i-1])*(x - X[i-1]) + Y[i-1] for an input
  value x, which falls between the points [X[i-1], x[i]].  For values
  outside the set of known points, the function will return the Y
  value for the nearest endpoint.

  The piecewise-linear function is described by a set of coordinates
  (X[i], Y[i]) for i in [0, N-1] which are contained in the input
  arrays x and y.

  The input table X must be sorted, either in strictly increasing
  or strictly decreasing order.  There must be no duplicate points
  in the X table, as this does not satisfy the criteria of a
  function, i.e. each x has only one corresponding y value.

  This implementation operates on an independent variable which
  is encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer, and dependent
  variable which is encoded as a 16-bit signed integer.  It is
  the responsibility of the user to select the correct interpolation
  function to match the given data types.

  @param x
  An array of N 32-bit unsigned integers which represent
  the x coordinates at the inflection points of a piecewise-linear
  function.  This array must be provided in sorted order either
  increasing or decreasing.  There must be no duplicate entries
  in the array.

  @param y
  An array of N 16-bit signed integers which represent
  the y coordinates at the inflection points of a piecewise-linear
  function.  Each element at index i in [0, N-1] is the corresponding
  y coordinate of the x[i] point.

  @param N
  The total number of points described in the x and y arrays.

  @param unknown
  The x coordinate at which the function should be evaluated at.

  @return
  The value of the piecewise-lineary function evaluated at the
  x value unknown.

  @brief
  Compute y=f(x) where f(x) is a piecewise-linear function described by
  a table of x and y coordinates, using linear interpolation between
  known points.

  @details
  This function computes
  ((Y[i] - Y[i-1])/(X[i] - X[i-1])*(x - X[i-1]) + Y[i-1] for an input
  value x, which falls between the points [X[i-1], x[i]].  For values
  outside the set of known points, the function will return the Y
  value for the nearest endpoint.

  The piecewise-linear function is described by a set of coordinates
  (X[i], Y[i]) for i in [0, N-1] which are contained in the input
  arrays x and y.

  The input table X must be sorted, either in strictly increasing
  or strictly decreasing order.  There must be no duplicate points
  in the X table, as this does not satisfy the criteria of a
  function, i.e. each x has only one corresponding y value.

  This implementation operates on an independent variable which
  is encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer, and dependent
  variable which is encoded as a 8-bit signed integer.  It is
  the responsibility of the user to select the correct interpolation
  function to match the given data types.

  @param x
  An array of N 32-bit unsigned integers which represent
  the x coordinates at the inflection points of a piecewise-linear
  function.  This array must be provided in sorted order either
  increasing or decreasing.  There must be no duplicate entries
  in the array.

  @param y
  An array of N 8-bit signed integers which represent
  the y coordinates at the inflection points of a piecewise-linear
  function.  Each element at index i in [0, N-1] is the corresponding
  y coordinate of the x[i] point.

  @param N
  The total number of points described in the x and y arrays.

  @param unknown
  The x coordinate at which the function should be evaluated at.

  @return
  The value of the piecewise-lineary function evaluated at the
  x value unknown.

  @brief
  Compute y=f(x) where f(x) is a piecewise-linear function described by
  a table of x and y coordinates, using linear interpolation between
  known points.

  @details
  This function computes
  ((Y[i] - Y[i-1])/(X[i] - X[i-1])*(x - X[i-1]) + Y[i-1] for an input
  value x, which falls between the points [X[i-1], x[i]].  For values
  outside the set of known points, the function will return the Y
  value for the nearest endpoint.

  The piecewise-linear function is described by a set of coordinates
  (X[i], Y[i]) for i in [0, N-1] which are contained in the input
  arrays x and y.

  The input table X must be sorted, either in strictly increasing
  or strictly decreasing order.  There must be no duplicate points
  in the X table, as this does not satisfy the criteria of a
  function, i.e. each x has only one corresponding y value.

  This implementation operates on an independent variable which
  is encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer, and dependent
  variable which is encoded as a 16-bit signed integer.  It is
  the responsibility of the user to select the correct interpolation
  function to match the given data types.

  @param x
  An array of N 16-bit signed integers which represent
  the x coordinates at the inflection points of a piecewise-linear
  function.  This array must be provided in sorted order either
  increasing or decreasing.  There must be no duplicate entries
  in the array.

  @param y
  An array of N 32-bit unsigned integers which represent
  the y coordinates at the inflection points of a piecewise-linear
  function.  Each element at index i in [0, N-1] is the corresponding
  y coordinate of the x[i] point.

  @param N
  The total number of points described in the x and y arrays.

  @param unknown
  The x coordinate at which the function should be evaluated at.

  @return
  The value of the piecewise-lineary function evaluated at the
  x value unknown.
