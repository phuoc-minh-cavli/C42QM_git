  This is a flag indicating, if the Calibration configruation packet(CCP) is for 
  the last sweep. Based on this flag, RF tear down will be done. 
   
  If the flag is FALSE, that means more calibration actions will be coming in 
  future. Thus Radio will not be torn down. However, ceasing of ISR and 
  dealloction of the configuration buffer and results buffer will be done for 
  this flag. This puts a requirement on the tools side to send a result fetch 
  command to embedded side before sending another CCP. 
   
  If the flag is TRUE, this indicates that there will no more associated 
  calibration actions. Thus tearing down of RF, ceasring ISR, dellocating 
  buffers will be done. 
   
  The main purpose of this flag is to support those call boxes which does not 
  support multiple PA State power measurement in a single sweep. Thus, if 
  the Tx Power Sweep on different PA states are distributed on various 
  Cal sweep commands, then this flag will be useful not to tear down radio
