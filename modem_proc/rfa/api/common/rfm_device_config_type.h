  @brief
  This structure defines a combination of devices, technologies, and bands
  which are incompatible in the current configuration.

  @details
  This data structure is used to return a table of mode combinations which
  are not compatible with the RF driver front end configuration in the
  target.  Most simultaneous configurations are expected to be valid, so
  only the disallowed configurations will be listed.

  As an example, assume an SVDO configuration where 1x and DO have no
  restrictions on single-chain operation, but if both 1x and HDR are
  on in BC0, neither technology can enable diversity.  This would be
  the case if there are only two BC0 antennas in the system, such that
  1x is using one antenna for its single-chain BC0 operation, and DO
  is using the other antenna for its single-chain BC0 operation.  With
  no antennas left, neither 1x nor DO can enable diversity.  Assume:
  - RFM_DEVICE_0: HDR Rx and Tx
  - RFM_DEVICE_1: HDR Rx diversity
  - RFM_DEVICE_2: 1x Rx and Tx
  - RFM_DEVICE_3: GPS
  - RFM_DEVICE_4: 1x Rx diversity

  A table with these rows:
  - { RFM_DEVICE_0, RFM_1XEVDO_MODE, RFM_CDMA_BC0, RFM_DEVICE_4, RFM_1X_MODE, RFM_CDMA_BC0 },
  - { RFM_DEVICE_2, RFM_1X_MODE, RFM_CDMA_BC0, RFM_DEVICE_1, RFM_1XEVDO_MODE, RFM_CDMA_BC0 }

  would mean:
  - "If HDR is on Device 0 on BC0 => 1x cannot use Device 4 for BC0 (diversity) AND
    If 1x is on Device 4 on BC0 (diversity) => HDR cannot use Device 0 for BC0"
  - "If 1x is on Device 2 on BC0 => HDR cannot use Device 1 for BC0 (diversity) AND
    If HDR is on Device 1 on BC0 (diversity) => 1x cannot use Device 2 for BC0"

  @brief
  This structure defines a bit mask for Multi-SIM capabilities

  @details
  RFM_SINGLE_RX_DSDS_SUPPORTED - In this dual-sim mode, only one technology is
    active at a given time, other technology is suspended when new tech comes
    up. Also referred to as tune away DSDS.
  RFM_DUAL_RX_DSDS_SUPPORTED  - Two receivers can be active simultaneously. For
    eg. LTE B1 TX+RX in connected state and GSM in paging. Some transceivers
    support DR-DSDS with a single WTR, some bands can be supported without
    diversity sharing (i.e. without giving up diversity). Some transceivers can
    only do DR-DSDS with diversity sharing since WTR3905 can only have two LNAs
    ON at any given time.
  RFM_DUAL_TX_DSDA_SUPPORTED  - This is supported on HW that has two independent
    TX chains available for DSDA, going out of two independent antennas. This is
    legacy DSDA implementation.
  RFM_SINGLE_TX_DSDA_SUPPORTED - One TX chain is time multi-plexed between two
    technologies. For eg, with some transceivers, LTE and GSM can be in
    connected mode simultaneously. LTE RX on CA1, GSM RX on CA2, and TX time
    shared between LTE and GSM.

  @brief
  Two dimensional matrix of Masks which will be used to indicate if
  simultaneous multi-tech is supported.

  @details
  This two dimensional matrix will be a symmetrical matrix. Each field will be a 
  mask where bit 0 indicates if simultaneous Rx is possible. On the other hand 
  bit 1 will indicate if simultaneous Tx is possible. For instance, 
  multi_tech_support[1x][HDR] = 0b00000011 indicates that SVDO is supported
  multi_tech_support[1x][HDR] = 0b00000001 indicated that SHDR is supported
  multi_tech_support[1x][LTE] = 0b00000011 indicated that SVLTE is supported
  multi_tech_support[GSM][LTE] = 0b00000011 indicated that SGLTE is supported

  instance, (RFM_SIMULTANEOUS_RX, enum in rfm_simultaneous_op_enum_type)'th
  bit starting from Least significant bit will indicate if simultaneous Rx is 
  supported. 1 in the bit-field indicates that simultaneous RF is 
  supported; whereas 0 indicates no support.

    The concurrency restrictions list modes and bands of operation that are
    incompatible with the current RF hardware configuration.  This will
    commonly be due to inter-antenna band restrictions, where two RF devices
    cannot simultaneously use the same antenna in certain bands.

    it does not provide any information about non-concurrent operation of
    a device on a given band or technology.  The basic capabilities of
    a device in a technology and band must be validated with the 
    rfm_is_band_chan_supported(), rfm_is_band_chan_supported_v2(), and
    rfm_is_tunable_on_antenna() APIs.
