                        GENERAL SLEEP DESCRIPTION
 =============================================================================*/

/* Sleep LPR management node
 *
 * The sleep LPR node is responsible for allowing registration of low power
 * resources (LPR's) each of which have one or more low power resource mode
 * (LPRM).  LPR's are resources critical to the compute path that will not be
 * needed when the processor is idle as turning them off provides a desirable
 * power savings (depending on the current dynamic conditions).
 *  
 * There are basically two tiers at which resources are filtered for whether or
 * not they enter a low power mode. The first is the explicit LPRM tracking:
 * NPA nodes for the affected resources will make requests into the sleep LPR
 * node.  Requests into the sleep LPR node are 32-bit bitmasks, where each set
 * bit is an enable signal for a given LPRM.  The mapping between bits and
 * LPRM's can be queried from the LPR node (see below for more detail).  Unless
 * an LPRM is requested by at least one client of the sleep LPR node, they are
 * considered explicity disabled and will not be considered for entry at idle
 * time.
 *  
 * The second and more complex tier is the sleep "solver."  The solver's task
 * is to look at all the enabled LPRM's and select the low power modes which
 * result in optimal power consumption based on the current expected sleep
 * period, latency restrictions, and temperature.  The solver functions
 * independently of the sleep LPR node, other than a simple query to figure out
 * which LPRM's are currently enabled.
 *
 * Making a request into this node (and thereby indicating to the LPRM tracking
 * system that a mode is able to be entered when the CPU has become idle) does
 * not mean that the resource necessarily *will* be put to sleep.  The actual
 * decision to select a sleep mode for entry is not made until idle time, when
 * the sleep solver will select modes based on what configurations would
 * provide the optimal power savings given the conditions that exist (expected
 * sleep length, latency budget, etc.). 
 *
 * However, when nobody has made a request into this node with a given bit set,
 * the LPRM associated with that bit is considered disabled.  This means that
 * regardless of whatever conditions may exist, the LPM solver cannot select a
 * low power resource mode until someone has made a request to enable it.
 *
 *                == Summary of supported operations ==
 *
 * Query this node with query id SLEEP_LPR_QUERY_BITMASK:
 *    - Takes an LPRM name string as an input in the 'reference' field.
 *    - LPRM name string should be immutable.
 *    - Returns the bitmask that should be requested into the sleep LPR field
 *      when the LPRM should be enabled as an output in the value field.
 *
 * Query this node with query id SLEEP_LPR_QUERY_RESOURCES:
 *    - Returns a pointer to the internal array of registered LPR's.  The array
 *      is returned in the reference field, but should only be accessed while
 *      in an INTLOCK'd context, as the array is raw internal node state.  This
 *      query should be exclusively used by the sleep solver to enumerate
 *      modes.
 *
 * Query this node with query id NPA_QUERY_CURRENT_STATE:
 *    - Returns a bitwise OR of all currently requested bitmasks.  This is
 *      basically the mask of LPRM's that are considered for selection when the
 *      sleep solver runs.
 *
 * Make a required request into this node:
 *    - For each set bit in the request bitmask, enables the associated LPRM
 *      for selection when the sleep solver runs.
 *
 * Complete a request into this node:
 *    - Remove the previously enabled LPRM's from consideration when the sleep
 *      solver runs.
