   The move distance can be specified in positive or negative directions
   (values). For example, a negative direction is used when seeking from the
   end of the file (_SEEK_END). If the seek type is _SEEK_CURRENT and the move
   distance is 0 (zero), this acts as a tell operation and returns the current
   position of the file pointer. Otherwise, the file pointer is moved by the
   specified distance from the specified origin.

   If the file was opened in _OFM_READ mode, this operation succeeds if
   the move distance from the specified origin is within the boundaries of
   the file. If the file was opened in _OFM_READWRITE mode and the move
   distance points to a location before the beginning of the file, this
   operation fails. If the move distance from the specified origin is past
   the end of the file, the file size is extended to the point of the move
   distance (from the seek origin).
