   FStat() is used to get information about an opened file handle. LStat()

   specified path name. They differ in how they treat the last component if
   it is a symlink. Stat() will dereference the symlink, returning the
   information on what the symlink points to. It gives the same perspective
   that a call to Open() or Opendir() would give of the symlink. These are
   the correct semantics for most applications wanting to find out about
   files.

   The LStat() call, on the other hand, provides information about any
   symlink. This call should be used by a type of application that must
   be aware of symlinks. The most common is a type of file browser that
   provides visibility into the real file types, including the presence of
   symlinks.
