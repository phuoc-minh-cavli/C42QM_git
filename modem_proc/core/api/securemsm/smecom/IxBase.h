   @brief 
   Generic defination of base class.

   Base class from which all the Ix classes are derived.
   It contains just pure virtual functions for AddRef and Release.

   Externalized Functions:
   AddRef,
   Release,
   GetState,
   SetState.

   Initialization and sequencing requirements:
   None.
