/**
Opens an SFS file with ixfile interface, and creates a subdirectory under the 
base path, if necessary. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file 
already exists, the file may be appended to or truncated. The options are 
specified by the File mode in the flag parameter. 

The subdirectory name is constructed based on the current base path. If the 
directory already exists in the underlying file system, a subdirectory with a 
mangled name is created under the parent directory, and the SFS file is stored 
in this new subdirectory. If this subdirectory already exists, it is reused so 
there is only one subdirectory per parent directory. 
  
An SFS file cannot be created directly under the root without a parent 
directory. The name of the file being created is also mangled in the 
underlying file system. The name-mangling conversion consists of a hash function 
followed by base64 encoding, with the resulting output from this process used as 
the created filename that is written to the file system. 

In the SFS, opening a file does not actually do anything in the file 
system. However, if the file (along with the associated file segments) already 
exists and the file is created with the IxFILE_OFM_TRUNCATE mode, the associated 
subfiles are deleted. The first segment is created only when new bytes to be 
written begin arriving.
