/*=========================================================================== 
This module contains functions and variables to support the generation
 of a pseudo-random sequence of numbers in accordance with the algorithm
 described in section 2.6.9 of the CDMA Digital CAI Standard. This algorithm
 is also presented, in great detail, in an article entitled "Random
 Number Generators: Good Ones Are Hard To Find", by Stephen K. Park and
 Keith W. Miller, Communications of the ACM, October 1988, Volume 31,
 Number 10.

 The algorithm uses the following iteration:

 z(n) = a x z(n-1) mod m

 where z(n) are integers, a = 7**5 = 16807, m = 2**31 - 1 = 2147483647.

 A generator based on this algorithm is known formally as a prime
 modulus multiplicative linear congruential generator.

 ---------------

 This module also contains a function to perform a hash of the mobile ESN and 
 some other relevant inputs:

 R = floor( N* (( 40503 * ( L ^ H ^ DECORR )) % 65536 ) / 65536 )

 L is bits 0-16 of the ESN, H is bits 16-31 of the ESN
 N and DECORR are chosen depending on the application ( CAI 2-216 )

 This formula is adapted from Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming,
 Vol 3, Sorting and Searching," ( Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1973 ),
 pp. 508-513

/**
  Initializes the pseudorandom number generator with a combination of 
  the Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) Real-Time Clock (RTC) time 
  and the phone's International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI). 
  This combination is an attempt to use a different seed for every mobile 
  and keep the seed consistent to give a better random number distribution.
  This function is called from tmc_libraries_init_after_tasks_start().
 
  @param[in] task_ptr      Pointer to the calling task's TCB.
  @param[in] task_wait_sig Task signal to wait for when reading from NV.
  @param[in] rex_sigs_type Task's wait function to be called when reading 
                           from NV.

   None.

  Seeds the pseudorandom number generator with a specified

  Random Number Generation Utility Services.

  @param[in] seed Value used to seed the pseudorandom number generator;
                  MUST be in the range of 0 < seed < 2**31 - 1. Note that 
                  the seed must NOT be zero and must NOT be 2**31 - 1.

  @return
  None.

  @dependencies
  This function stores the specified seed in the ran_reg variable, 
  which is defined globally for this module.

  @sideeffects
  The ran_reg variable is set to the specified seed value, which influences 
  the sequence of pseudorandom numbers that will be generated.
