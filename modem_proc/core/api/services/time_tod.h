GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  Implements time-keeping functions using the slow clock.

  Slow Clock Frequency         Granularity      Time Range
    30.000kHz (lower limit)      33.3 us         39.7 hrs
    32.768kHz (nominal freq)     30.5 us         36.4 hrs
    60.000kHz (upper limit)      16.6 us         19.8 hrs


EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  get_time_tod_rtc_status 

  time_tod_set Set the slow-clock based time-of-day to the given timestamp

  time_tod_set_secs Set the slow-clock based time-of-day to the given time 
  in seconds

  time_tod_get_ms Get the time from TOD source, in # of milliseconds since 
  "the beginning of time".

  time_tod_add_rtc_offset Time of day is maintained as an offset from PMIC 
  RTC time. 

  time_tod_get_20ms_frame_time This procedure is returns the 64-bit system 
  timestamp in units of 20 millisecond frame time (traffic / paging / access 
  channel frame time).

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
    time_tod_init() must be called from time_init()
    time_tod_set() must be called before time_tod_get().
    A valid slow clock estimate is required for time_tod_get().
