  @brief
  Diagnostic Services API definitions specific to Windows devices

  This file contains APIs necessary to initialize Diagnostic services on 
  Windows devices. This additional initialization is necessary to support
  Diagnostic services on multiple process-spaces. On Windows phones, 
  Diagnostic Service API definitions are provided by the dynamic link library,
  Diag_LSM.dll.
  
  @note
  This file should be used only on Windows devices (Win-mobile 6.x and Windows Phone 7).

--------   ---     ---------------------------------------------------------- 
08/30/10   mad     Modified comment for WINDIAG_TASK_INIT_COMPLETE_EVT_NAME
06/02/10   mad     Doxygenated
10/05/09   mad     Added Event to announce completion of Diag initialization.
                   This can be used by msgoutput driver to switch Debug output
                   to QXDM.
05/10/09   as      Extended the scope of extern to include Diag_LSM_DeInit
01/10/09   as      Fixed extern for __cplusplus 
07/07/09   mad     Included comdef.h
12/02/08   mad     Changed function description for device-driver model diag
02/04/08   mad     Added declarations for Diag_LSM_Init and DeInit functions
                   to enable diag clients to call these directly.
                   Moved IDiagPkt handle declaration to an internal header 
                   file, Diag_LSMi.h

@ingroup diag_misc
Name of Windows synchronization event that clients can wait on, to get 
notification that Diag is ready for use. Clients that come up earlier in the
boot-up sequence can wait on this event, before calling Diag_LSM_Init() or 
using other Diag APIs. 
 
Clients need to obtain event HANDLE with the flag settings given as follows:
CreateEvent(NULL, FALSE, FALSE, WINDIAG_TASK_INIT_COMPLETE_EVT_NAME);
