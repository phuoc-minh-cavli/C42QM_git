used to create multiple tasks using the aforementioned API but care must be taken to re-initialize
the task attributes that need to be changed for every task like stack address, name etc.

rex_task_lock prevents context switching from the point at which it is

REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE elevates the priority of the calling task to a
system defined high priority value. This API is to be used in conjunction with 
REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_ENABLE which then restores the task's priority back to 
what it was before the call to REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE.

This is done so as to provide the calling task with enough MIPS to complete 
any operations within the REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE/REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_ENABLE
block. This could be used for example to complete a sequence of hardware register
reads/writes. Please note that this API does not guarantee mutual exclusion.

@return
None.

@note Consider using this API as a replacement for the deprecated task lock APIs.
@note REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE will not block interrupts from occurring.
On single core CPUs, this has the implication that ISTs will preempt the task, 
that called REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE but after the IST runs to completion, due 
to the priority elevation, the scheduler will schedule the thread that called
REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE. On SMP/IMT cores, it is expected that the task will 
not be preempted on the core/hardware thread that it is running on. 
Other tasks/threads including IST tasks could be scheduled on other cores/hardware 
threads, therefore this API is not meant to be used for mutual exclusion.
@note It is not advised to perform any blocking calls when in the 
REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE/REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_ENABLE block as that will 
cause a reschedule. If this is done, a situation could arise where some other task 
calls REX_TASK_PREEMPTION_DISABLE. If this occurs then depending on the scheduler
implementation and underlying CPU hardware we could potentially have round robin 
scheduling among the tasks that have been bumped up to the system defined 
high priority value. This may not be desirable for applications.
