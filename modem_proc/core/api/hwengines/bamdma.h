when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ------------------------------------------------------------
4/12/12    rl      Changed 'bamdma_get_freebytes'. 'bamdma_get_max_descriptors' returns
                   the max descriptors supported by the bamdma bam.
11/11/11   rl      add async api,replaced generic types with standard typedefs.
09/01/11   rl      Created
