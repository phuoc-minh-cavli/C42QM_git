 * The EFS_ASYNC_PUT module provides support to asynchornously write to EFS2
 * special item files to time sensitive EFS2 clients that do not want to be
 * blocked until data is written to the storage.

/**
 * @defgroup efs_async_put_pathnames Pathnames
 * @ingroup efs_async_put
 *
 * The pathnames follow same syntax as EFS2 pathnames. They consist of null
 * terminated strings of UTF-8 encoded character data.  Directories
 * are separated using the forward slash character '/'.  Please note that
 * pathnames are not checked for UTF-8 validity, a name component is simply
 * terminated when a '/' or null is encountered.
 *
 * Absolute pathnames begin with a slash, and relative pathnames omit the
 * initial slash.  (Since the current implementation does not allow the
 * 'current' directory to be changed, these resolve the same).  There are
 * two special names: "." which refers to the current directory, and ".."
 * which refers to the parent directory.
 *
 * An individual name component of a path (between slashes) can be no more
 * than FS_NAME_MAX characters in length.  An entire path is limited
 * FS_PATH_MAX characters. See fs_config.h for FS_PATH_MAX configuration.

/**
 * @par Name:
 *  efs_async_put - Store a value in an EFS2 'special item' file.
 *
 * @par Synopsis:
 *  @code
 *    #include "fs_async_put.h"
 *    int efs_async_put (const char *path, void *data, fs_size_t length,
 *                       int oflag, int mode);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * @par Description:
 *  Queue request to store a value in an EFS2 'special item' file. It only
 *  queues the request and the write itself will be processed later by a low
 *  priority task when it gets scheduled to run. The API is similar to the EFS2
 *  API efs_put in that it requests writing to an item file but unlike efs_put
 *  it does not block the caller until data is commited to storage.
 *
 * @par Limitations:
 *    ::API can fail if the queue of requests is full because the processing
 *      task did not get scheduled to run yet.\n
 *    ::The processing task has very low priority and any higher priority task
 *      can cause it to starve.
 *    ::Requests are processed in FIFO order and not in requesting tasks'
 *      priorities.\n
 *    ::Since items in queue will not get written until the processing task
 *      becomes runnable a successfully queued item may not get committed
 *      to the disk in case of an ungraceful shutdown of the phone.\n
 *    ::Calling efs_get after a request to efs_async_put will return the value
 *      last successfully written to the storage which may not be the same as
 *      last reuqest made in a successful call to efs_async_put.
 *
 * @param path
 *  The path of the item-file.
 *
 * @param data
 *  The start-address of the data.
 *
 * @param length
 *  The length indicates the size of the item-file.
 *
 * @param oflag
 *  The 'oflag' argument describes how this file should be created, and
 *  'oflag' should be a bitwise OR of one of the following:\n
 *    O_CREAT   - Create the item if it does not exist.\n
 *    O_EXCL    - Fail if the item already exists.\n
 *    O_AUTODIR - Auto create parent directories.\n
 *
 * @param ...
 *    @b mode
 *    The mode argument specifies the permissions given to the file. \n
 *    One or more of the following permission bits can be
 *    OR'd as the mode parameter:
 *  @par
 *    ::S_IRUSR   : Read permission for User      \n
 *    ::S_IWUSR   : Write permission for User     \n
 *    ::S_IXUSR   : Execute permission for User   \n
 *    ::S_IRGRP   : Read permission for Group     \n
 *    ::S_IWGRP   : Write permission for Group    \n
 *    ::S_IXGRP   : Execute permission for Group  \n
 *    ::S_IROTH   : Read permission for Other     \n
 *    ::S_IWOTH   : Write permission for Other    \n
 *    ::S_IXOTH   : Execute permission for Other  \n
 *    ::S_ISUID   : Set UID on execution          \n
 *    ::S_ISGID   : Set GID on execution          \n
 *    ::S_ISVTX   : Sticky bit (Hidden attrib in FAT)    \n
 *
 *
 * @return
 *  Returns a zero if the item is successfully queued to be written or -1 for
 *  error.
 *
 * @par Errors:
 *  Upon error, the efs_errno will be set to one of the following:\n
 *    ::EINVAL       - Invalid parameter.\n
 *    ::ENAMETOOLONG - The 'path' specified, or a component of it is
 *                     longer than FS_PATH_MAX.\n
 *    ::FS_ERANGE    - 'length' is greater than FS_ASYNC_PUT_MAX_DATA_BYTES.\n
 *    ::ENOSPC       - The queue storing write requests is full and cannot take
 *                     new requests until existing requests are processed.\n
 * @sa
