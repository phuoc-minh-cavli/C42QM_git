when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
02/27/14   mr      Doxygen complaint PMIC Header (CR-602405)
12/06/13   mr      (Tech Pubs) Edited/added Doxygen comments and markup (CR-522045)
10/20/09   jtn     Move init function prototype to pm_device_init_i.h
10/23/08   jtn     Added API pm_hal_rtc_prescaler_reset()
06/18/07   cng     Added meta comments to miscellaneous RTC APIs
05/31/06   Vish    Fixed LINT warnings.
05/03/05   Vish    Modified pm_hal_rtc_get_time() to read RTC time even in
                   the case when RTC was not running.
01/19/05   Vish    Updated function header for pm_hal_rtc_get_time().
01/28/04   rmd     Added initial support for multiple PMIC models/tiers.
11/07/03   Vish    Added the task of clearing the alarm trigger condition
                   within pm_hal_rtc_disable_alarm() so that the master
                   RTC alarm interrupt could be cleared afterward.
10/02/03   Vish    Added pm_hal_rtc_get_alarm_time() and
                   pm_hal_rtc_get_alarm_status().
09/23/03   Vish    Changed all pm_rtc_xxx variables/fns to pm_hal_rtc_xxx.
09/13/03   Vish    Created.
