when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
02/27/14   mr      Doxygen complaint PMIC Header (CR-602405)
12/06/13   mr      (Tech Pubs) Edited/added Doxygen comments and markup (CR-522045)
02/08/11   hw      Merging changes from the PMIC Distributed Driver Arch branch
02/13/09   vk      Removed feature FEATURE_PMIC_RTC from .h file for RPC. 
06/28/07   cng     Added meta comments to RTC APIs
06/18/07   cng     Added meta comments to pm_rtc_rw_cmd
03/07/07   aab     Added pm_rtc_get_power_reset_status() API
05/31/06   Vish    Fixed LINT warnings.
01/19/05   Vish    Updated function header for pm_rtc_rw_cmd().
11/07/03   Vish    Added the task of clearing the alarm trigger condition
                   within pm_reset_rtc_alarm() so that the master
                   RTC alarm interrupt could be cleared afterward. Also
                   resetting all alarms within pm_rtc_init() to avoid
                   any false alarms.
11/03/03   Vish    Changed signature of pm_rtc_init().
                   Renamed pm_s/get_time_adjust() to pm_rtc_s/get_time_adjust()
                   in order to be consistent with earlier PM chip libraries.
                   Added documentation. Wrapped this file under
                   FEATURE_PMIC_RTC.
10/02/03   Vish    Adding alarm support.
09/24/03   Vish    Added pm_rtc_init().
09/19/03   Vish    Created.
