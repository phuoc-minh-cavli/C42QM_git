/* Copies all the pages in a block from source to destination.
 *
 * Data in NAND is stored in pages, the pages group together into erasable
 * chunks called blocks. This function will take care of:
 *
 * 1. Erasing the destination block.
 * 2. Copying all the pages from the source block to the destination block.
 * 3. If flash erase/program error occurs:
 * 3.1 Erase the block (if required).
 * 3.2 Mark block as bad and return error.
 *
 * If there are erased gaps withing a block, this function will also
 * replicate them.
 *
 * @param src_handle Flash handle for the source partition, returned by open.
 * @param src_block  Block within the source handle to copy.
 * @param dest_handle Flash handle for the destination partition.
 * @param dest_blk    Block number in the destination where to place the data
 *
 * @return The number of pages successfully copied, -1 on error.
