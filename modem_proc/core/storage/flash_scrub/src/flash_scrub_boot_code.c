 *
 * Scrub image read by PBL.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2013-2014, 2017, 2019 QUALCOMM Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * In PBL (or boot ROM) supports reading the boot image from anywhere
 * in the first 15 blocks. The SBL image PBL loads is usually no more than 2
 * blocks. This feature allows the image to be relocated/reprogrammed
 * somewhere in disk within the partition.
 *
 * The requirements of PBL to handle power down safe is that the last page
 * of the first block of the image must be the last page to be programmed.
 * For this reason, the images are written from the last block to the first
 * block. Within a block the data is written sequentially. This guarantees
 * gracefully handling sudden power downs.
 *
 * PBL reads the sectors sequentially. In the diagram below, it will load
 * SBL_A, where SBL_A spans two blocks.
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | SBL_A_1 | SBL_A_2 | erased | erased | erased | SBL_B_1 | SBL_B_2 |
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Blocks 0 and 1 have to be erased in order to boot from SBL_B. The diagram
 * above will be condensed to:
 * A-E-B: SBL_A followed by erased blocks, then SBL_B.
 * A-E-E: SBL_A all other blocks are erased.
 * E-E-B: SBL_B is at the end of the device, all other blocks are erased.
 *
 * This module can be viewed as a state machine of 2 states. The state is
 * stored in EFS and read back on power up, that way the operation can be
 * resumed. States are:
 * 1. Ready: Finished with previous operation. Ready to initiate the next.
 * 2. Erase oldest SBL copy: Two copies of SBL exist, Erase the oldest.
 *
 * Apart from the 2 states of the state machine, the state contains the
 * block number the newest SBL image and the location of the latest SBL
 * image: Low or High. The location 'Low' means that the next scrub the
 * image needs to be copied to a 'High' block number
 *
 * The 2 states of the machine are cycled in order. The overall algorithm is:
 *
 * 1. State 'Ready', Location 'Low'. (A-E-E)
 * 2. Scrub initiated.
 * 3. Copy the blocks from the beginning of the partition to the end. (A-E-B)
 * 4. Save the state as 'Erase Oldest'. (A-E-B)
 * 5. Erase the first SBL copy.
 * 6. Save state as 'Ready', and location as 'High'. (E-E-B)
 * 7. Scrub initiated.
 * 8. Copy SBL from the end of the device to the beginning.
 * 9. Save the state 'Erase Oldest' (A-E-B)
 * 10. Erase the last copy of SBL.
 * 11. Save state as 'Ready', and location as 'Low'. (A-E-E)
