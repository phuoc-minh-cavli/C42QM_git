 * extra unnecessary GC, overall read or write throughput degrades.
 *
 * If the free space is less then FS_NOR_MAX_ERASED_BLOCKS limit then
 * incremental GC is being performed, which is non-blocking in nature.

/* Calculation for max number of GC Move log entries that can be packed in a
 * log page is as follows:
 *
 * Number of bytes available in a log page for log entries:
 * PAGE_SIZE - HEADERS_SIZE - LOG_PAD => PAGE_SIZE - 8 - 4
 * Here LOG_PAD Includes the CRC and the log end marker
 *
 * So, for 512 page config (which is default for NOR) we can have maximum of
 * (512 - 8 - 4) / GC_MOV_LOG_SIZE => 500 / 13 = 38
 *
 * So there could be 38 GC_MOVE log entries in a log page.
 *
 * When doing GC in the worst case, if we have to move 38 pages while doing
 * urgent garbage collection, log flush will happen after 38 pages are written
 * if power fails after 38 pages move and before log is flushed, all those 38
 * pages will become garbage and hence marked as garbage in the next powerup
 * init. This number would decide on how many pages extra free space we need
 * to maintain in addition to 1 block of free space. So that in the event of a
 * bad power down, we should still be able to recover and proceed doing GC to
 * reclaim free space.
 *
 * Since urgent garbage collection happens before the transaction is written
 * there is still a chance that the urgent garbage collection is not triggered
 * and the transaction consumes max consumable space and on the power up
 * urgent GC we should still be able to recover the bad power down for that we
 * need to add the maximum transaction consumption number of pages for the
 * urgency free count overhead.
 *
 * So having 38 will recover from 1 bad powerdown, consequent similar bad
 * powerdown will result into a situation where we don't have enough freespace
 * to move good pages to do GC which would reclaim freespace, thus crashing.
 * This number would really be a tradeoff between how small a file system we
 * want to be to how much safer we want to be against consequent bad
 * powerdowns in the worst case, even though because of incremental garbage
 * collection its very *unlikely* to get into this situation that easily.
 * Currently in very rare scenarios in full EFS conditions, EFS might lockup
 * because of less free space to do GC which recovers free space. It will be
 * addressed in the coming up release.

 * Calculate the limits of GC Thresholds and Bad block margins.
 *
 * Min_Threshold and Max_Threshold are Thresholds of physically available free
 * pages that are the key factors used to make a decision whether to run GC or
 * not at any instance. Other factors affecting the decision is the build time
 * configuration setting FS_PM_GC_OVERHEAD_WRITES_PER_TXN which specifies how
 * many overhead extra page writes can be done during GC per transaction. This
 * being a softlimit is obeyed only if it is possible. If the free space goes
 * below critical limit then it is ignored.
 *
 * The algorithm for decision is described in function fs_pm_urgency.
 *
 * Bad block margin is how many blocks can go bad, and still EFS should be
 * able to work properly with EFS 100% full and still obey the above limits
 * while doing GC giving reasonable performance.
 *
 * Since we need some operating margin for GC, here is how the data region
 * is logically divided:
 *
 * Data_region = space_limit + Min_Threshold + Bad_Blocks + Max_Threshold.
 *
 * Since space_limit is calculated just once during fresh start, we would
 * take the value whatever that was configured. So rest of the three values
 * need to be calculated, the calculation should result correct usable numbers
 * for the complete wide range configuration size of EFS configurations.
 * Typically the range of Data region is from 32 blocks to more than 2048
 * blocks. Since the threshold values cannot be varied too much in range
 * will have to take some consideration of the size of the region to
 * get optimal values for them. Bad block percent is configurable by the
 * customers, but will have to make sure that it wouldn't lead to 0 bad blocks
 * Since manufacturer specifies sometimes that the device may contain 4% bad
 * blocks already when the device ships from factory and additional bad blocks
 * may develop over usage.
 *
 * Here are the typical range of values and the relation:
 *
 * space_limit = 95% of Data_region - 5 blks; (Existing/old Calculation)
 * Bad_Blocks = Bad Block% of Data_region; (Configurable)
 *
 * Min_Threshold = [3 to 5]; // depending on the Data_region size.
 * Max_Threshold = [Min_Threshold + 1 to 9];
 *
 * Because of this equation, if the region develops bad blocks more than
 * allowed by the preset config, it would cause fatal error, since our
 * GC cannot yield to bad blocks out of its operating margin.
 *
 * These following calculations are needed for GC to run, so for first
 * time GC also, these calculations are needed, so calculate before running the
 * GC for the first time. */
