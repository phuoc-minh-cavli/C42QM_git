   SMSM hosts and entries size information.

   These values are set in smem_boot_init() in the Apps' sbl2, before any 
   processor calls smem_init().  In each smem_init(), the SMSM shared memory
   items will be allocated with a size based on these values.  E.g., the
   state_shared has num_entries words, and the intr_mask is a 2D array of 
   dimensions num_hosts * num_entries.  This will prevent future interprocessor
   dependencies on these values because they must only be changed once when 
   set in smem_boot_init().
