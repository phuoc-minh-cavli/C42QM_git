* The following environment variables are required. The can be passed through
  make command as well.

  - Q6_RTOS_ROOT  --- QURT install directory

  - Q6_TOOLS_ROOT --- Tools installation location

  - TARGET        --- Target under QURT install. eg. 9x00. 


* Instructions to build and run the example

  - Set the environment variables

  - make

* NOTE: The test will fail the TARGET QURT install doesn't support demand

# Description #
###############

The a.linker linker script files demonstrates how to put sepcial sections
into swapped segments. Please follow the reference of "paged0" segment.

The following symbols are needed to tell kernel to reserve virtual range
for swapped segments at start up.
           __swapped_segments_start__
           __swapped_segments_end__

These symbols are declared as weak so that if they are not specified,
they will be zero by default, and thus the page fault handler is
bypassed.

* Instructions to run and step through the example using T32

  - Add the following to the PATH environment variable
    - <Tools path>\qc\bin
    - <Tools path>\iss\bin
    - <Tools path>\iss\bin\<Q6 version> (Not Required for V4 targets.)

  - cd to <build dir>
  - t32mqdsp6.exe -c t32sim.cfg (Make sure you have the <X:\T32> added to PATH)
  - Ignore license warning if any
  - On the T32 window, "do t32sim.cmm"
