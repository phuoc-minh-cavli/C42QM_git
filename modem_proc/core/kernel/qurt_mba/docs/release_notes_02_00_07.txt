HEXAGON QuRT RTOS VERSION 02.00.07 - RELEASE NOTES 

* Overview
    - Kernel
    - QuRT User library
    - OSAM
    - Bug Fixes 

* Kernel
    - PI futex support
        Enabled PI futex by default with turning on CONFIG_PI_FUTEX for modemv5 uncore target
        Disabled previous PI mutex with turning off CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE
    - Removed the kernel futex array and used the PI futex array for kernel operation on regular mutex/signal/sem etc when there is contention.
    - Use QURTK_futex_entry_t to replace  QURTK_pi_futex_entry_t so that both PI futexes and non-PI futexes can share the same pool.
    - Optimize futex_wait/futex_resume for accurate step order on input validation. And optimized mutex code and reduced packets in 
      mutex/rmutex_unlock upto kernel trap0 - from original 6 pkts to 4 ptks.
    - Remove QURTK_curr_tcb asm function and use inline code for replacement to simply the logic.
    - Extend kernel support for 128-entry TLB on v5 architecture. To reserve N tlb entries to be manipulated at run time, use 
        tlb_first_replaceable=N instead of tlb index as was the case previously. The name will change in upcoming release to reflect correct
        semantics. 

* QuRT user library
    - Moved the queue field in mutex struct to the 3rd word, in sync with signal/sem/barrier struct. 
    - Reduced the mutex struct from 24bytes to 16 bytes
    - QURT_API_VERSION changed to 3.

* OSAM
    - Supported new futex list for both PI Futexes and non-PI futexes

* Bug Fixes
    - Fixed the issue of http://aus-bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6969
    - Fixed incorrect setting of global bit for static memory
