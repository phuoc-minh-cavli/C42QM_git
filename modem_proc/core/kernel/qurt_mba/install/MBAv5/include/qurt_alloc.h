                   returns a void pointer to the allocated space or NULL if there is insufficient

  SIDE EFFECTS    Users are recommended to deprecate using these functions, switching to plain
                   malloc/free call from C library since they are going to be thread safe too.

/**
  FUNCTION        qurt_realloc

  DESCRIPTION     Reallocate memory block. Wrap the C library, but with a lock
									The size of the memory block pointed to by the ptr parameter is changed to the 
									size bytes, expanding or reducing the amount of memory available in the block.
									The function may move the memory block to a new location, in which case the new
									location is returned. The content of the memory block is preserved up to the lesser
									of the new and old sizes, even if the block is moved. If the new size is larger, the 
									value of the newly allocated portion is indeterminate.
	                In case that ptr is NULL, the function behaves exactly as malloc, assigning a new
	                block of size bytes and returning a pointer to the beginning of it.
	                In case that the size is 0, the memory previously allocated in ptr is deallocated as
	                if a call to free was made, and a NULL pointer is returned.

	@param *ptr [IN] Pointer to a memory block previously allocated with malloc, calloc or realloc to be
	                reallocated. If this is NULL, a new block is allocated and a pointer to it is returned
	                by the function.
	@param newsize [IN] size for the memory block, in bytes.
	                If it is 0 and ptr points to an existing block of memory, the memory block pointed by
	                ptr is deallocated and a NULL pointer is returned. 
	
  DEPENDENCIES   None

  @return void * [OUT] 
                  A pointer to the reallocated memory block, which may be either the same as the
                  ptr argument or a new location.
	                The type of this pointer is void*, which can be cast to the desired type of data 
	                pointer in order to be dereferenceable.
	                If the function failed to allocate the requested block of memory, a NULL pointer is
	                returned, and the memory block pointed to by argument ptr is left unchanged.
	 
  SIDE EFFECTS    Users are recommended to deprecate using these functions, switching to plain
                  * malloc/free call from C library since they are going to be thread safe too.
