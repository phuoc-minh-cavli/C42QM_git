/**
	FUNCTION				qurt_interrupt_register

	DESCRIPTION 		The function enables an interrupt. The calling thread will be registered as 
								  IST (Interrupt Service Thread) of the interrupt. An IST thread can register 
								  up to 31 interrupts as limited by the number of bits (leftmost bit 31 is 
								  reserved by Qurt) in a signal variable.
								 
								  Whenever an interrupt occurs, the Qurt kernel generates the signal that is 
								  specified in the signal mask for this interrupt and delivers the signal to 
								  IST via "int_signal" variable.
								 
								  Qurt reserves some interrupts for internal use, the remainder are available 
								  for use by applications, and thus are valid interrupt numbers. If the specified 
								  interrupt number is outside the valid range, the register operation returns EINT.
								 
  NOTE 		        signal number 31 (SIG_INT_ABORT) is reserved for notifying the IST 
 					        that no interrupt is registered. This is useful when other threads 
 					        de-register all the interrupts previously registered by the IST. 
 					        Qurt kernel sends the signal to wake up the IST if it is still waiting 
 					        to receive interrupts.

	 @param int_num [IN] Interrupt number
	 @param int_signal [IN] Signal set (holds up to 31 user-defined signals: 0~30)
	 @param signal_mask	[IN] Contains the signal to be generated when registered interrupt occurs

	DEPENDENCIES 	None		

	@return         EOK Successfully registered
	@return         EINT    Invalid int_num, e.g.
                     -   >31 in case of L1 interrupt
                     -   Non-existed L2 interrupt
                     -   OS reserved
	@return         ESIG    Invalid signal mask (Can only set one bit at a time in signal_mask)
	@return         EVAL    Interrupt has been registered

 * Wait for registered interrupt signal
 *
 * Description
 *
 * Suspend the current thread until one of its registered interrupts occurs. The second input, "mask", 
 * contains the interrupt signals the IST expects to receive. The interrupt signals are registered 
 * with interrupts via qurt_register_interrupt API.
 *
 * The signals returned in "signal" variable indicate which interrupts occurred. Use function 
 * qurt_anysignal_get to read the signals. IST shall locally maintain a table that maps a signal to 
 * a specific interrupt. IST shall also check if signal SIG_INT_ABORT is received. If so, the IST 
 * shall quit from interrupt receiving loop.
 *
 * For detail information on this API, see Qurt User Manual Section 4.2.5

	FUNCTION				qurt_interrupt_acknowledge

	DESCRIPTION 		Re-enable an interrupt after process it.
	                After an interrupt is taken, it will be disabled by Qurt.
	                To re-enable it, IST need acknowledge the interrupt.

	                qurt_anysignal_clear() function before acknowledge 
	 						    the interrupt. Otherwise, re-occurring interrupt may be lost.
	 
	 						    IST shall instruct the device to clear the interrupt before
	 						    acknowledge it. Otherwise, the same interrupt could be 
	 						    re-processed.

	FUNCTION				qurt_interrupt_deregister

	DESCRIPTION 		Disable the IST from receiving the interrupt.
									Disable the interrupt and deregister IST as the handler
									thread of the interrupt.
									Application threads including IST call this function to
									deregister an interrupt. If deregistration happens during
									IST is waiting to receive interrupt, the IST will probably
									be stuck in waiting for the interrupts that will never occur.
									To avoid the problem, the Qurt kernel sends signal 
									SIG_INT_ABORT to wake up the IST after figuring out the IST
									has no interrupts registered.
									If the specified interrupt was not registered before, the 
									deregister function returns EINT.
