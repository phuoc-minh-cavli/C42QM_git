/*
||  Method numbers used for QDI
||
||  Here is the intended grouping of method numbers for QDI
||   including future usage:
||
||   Method 0 should always be unused and not responded to by
||    any driver.
||   Methods 1 and 2 are reserved for name registration and
||    name lookup.
||   Methods 3 through 31 are reserved for POSIX-type operations
||    on open handles.
||   Methods 32 through 127 are reserved for the QDI infrastructure
||    and may be extended in the future to provide standard
||    driver debug services, management services, and system
||    notifications.
||   Methods 128 through 255 are reserved for the use of automatically
||    generated methods such as might be generated by an IDL (interface
||    definition language).  The infrastructure may be extended to
||    perform services on these methods based on information provided
||    by the IDL, such as automatic buffer validation, etc.  These
||    method numbers should not be used for any "ad hoc" methods.
||   Methods with number >= 256 are "private" method numbers which are
||    outside the scope of the QDI infrastructure.  Drivers which want
||    to generate and consume their own "ad hoc" methods are free to
||    use these method numbers as they wish.  The infrastructure will
||    not generate these method numbers or respond to them, but will
||    pass them on unmolested.
||
||   Note that all driver implementations *should* return a value of
||    -1 when called with an unsupported method.  The standard error
||    return value for POSIX APIs is -1, so we emulate that behavior
||    here.
