/**
 * User-visible API to open a QDI device driver.
 *
 * qurt_qdi_open() is the primary mechanism by which a driver user can
 *  obtain a QDI handle.  The user provides the name of the driver
 *  to the qurt_qdi_open() call, and gets back a handle referencing
 *  the named driver.
 * qurt_qdi_open() takes one mandatory parameter -- the driver name.
 *  A 2nd and 3rd parameter are optional and should follow the
 *  POSIX open() convention.  The 2nd parameter, if present,
 *  may indicate the handle access which is requested (read-only,
 *  write-only, or read-write, for instance) and other flags such
 *  as whether the call should create a new device or only open
 *  an existing device.  The 3rd parameter, if present, may
 *  indicate the permissions to be configured when a new device
 *  is created.  Note that QDI, unlike POSIX open(), does not
 *  mandate the existence of the 2nd parameter; also, QDI does
 *  not specify the format of the 2nd and 3rd parameters, but
 *  drivers are encouraged to stick with the POSIX semantics.
 *
 * @param  name   Device name to be opened
 * @param  flags  Optional 2nd parameter (POSIX flags)
 * @param  mode   Optional 3rd parameter (POSIX mode)
 *
 * @return non-negative integer handle if successful
 * @return negative error code if the driver could not be opened

/**
 * Prepare for direct manipulation of a possibly untrusted buffer
 *  provided by a QDI client.
 *
 * qurt_qdi_lock_buffer() is used to permit a trusted driver to safely
 *  access memory which is provided by a possibly untrusted client.
 * Prior to directly accessing a memory buffer provided by a client,
 *  a QDI driver should use qurt_qdi_lock_buffer() to obtain a safe buffer
 *  pointer for access.  This fulfills two requirements -- first, it
 *  checks that the entire buffer is accessible to the client; second,
 *  it ensures that the pointer remains valid for the remainder of the
 *  QDI driver operation.
 * The perms parameter is a bit mask integer requesting read or write
 *  access for the buffer in question:
 *    QDI_PERM_R to request read access
 *    QDI_PERM_W to request write access
 *    QDI_PERM_RW to request read/write access
 * When in a LOCAL or TRUSTED state, this function does no checking or
 *  locking, but just returns the user's pointer as *obuf and returns
 *  0 to indicate no error.
 * When in an UNTRUSTED state, this function may return an error, which
 *  indicates that the buffer cannot be safely accessed by the driver.
 *  Generally, this indicates that the user passed a buffer for which
 *  the requested access permission was not available.  If this function
 *  returns non-zero, generally the QDI invocation should be failed
 *  cleanly, with an appropriate error code returned to the client (this
 *  is analogous to the POSIX standard of returning EFAULT to indicate
 *  that accessing a memory buffer would cause a fault from user mode).
 *  If the function returns 0 (success), then the QDI driver should use
 *  the pointer at *obuf to perform its memory accesses rather than using
 *  the pointer passed in as buf -- even if the user process changes the
 *  mapping of memory at buf, the mapping of memory at *obuf should remain
 *  valid until the QDI invocation completes.
