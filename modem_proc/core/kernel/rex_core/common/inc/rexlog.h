DESCRIPTION
  Contains memory debug information.

  alloc_num:       A unique ID for this memory allocation operation

  mem_ptr:         A pointer to the allocated memory

  size:            The size in bytes of the allocated memory

  alloc_tcb_id:    The ID of the task that performed this particular
                   allocation

  alloc_line_num:  The line number in the file where the call to allocate
                   memory was made 

  alloc_heap_used: The number of bytes used in the heap after the memory
                   allocation

  free_tcb_id:     The ID of the task that freed the allocated memory. This

  free_line_num:   The line number in the file where the call to free
                   memory was made. This will be zero if the memory has not
                   been freed yet.

  free_heap_used:  The number of bytes used in the heap just before the memory
                   was freed.  This will be zero if the memory has not been
                   freed yet.
 
  status:          A field of type mem_debug_status_type that indicates the
                   status of the allocation. The possible values are
                   MEM_DEBUG_STATUS_OK             = 1

                   from which memory was allocated

  alloc_file_name: A null-terminated string containing the name of the file
                   from which the call to allocate memory was made.

  free_file_name:  A null-terminated string containing the name of the file
                   from which the call to free memory was made. This string
                   will be empty if the memory has not been freed yet.

PACKET   Per Task Profiling Information

ID       LOG_TASKPROFILE_C

DESCRIPTION
  Contains profiling information for a specific task. The same packet is
  also used to send profiling information about ISRs. Many of the fields
  will be zero or null for ISRs because the fields do not make sense in
  that context.

  task_id:    Unique identifier for the task or ISR.

  sp:         The stack pointer stored in the TCB of the task (except for
              the current task, for which we return the contents of the
              stack pointer register)
  
  sigs:       The value of the sigs field from the task's TCB. This represents
              the mask of signals set for the task.

  wait:       The value of the wait field from the task's TCB. This represents
              the mask of signals on which the task is currently waiting.

  pri:        The value of the pri field from the task's TCB. This denotes
              the priority of the task.

  time_samples: A measure of the CPU time used by the task. This field contains
              the number of time samples during which this task was running,
              if this is available. Otherwise this field is set to the
              value of the slices field in the TCB. The slices field denotes
              the number of times a task has been scheduled. Bit 2 of the
              info_mask field determines which of the two meanings applies.

  total_samples: The total number of time samples elapsed so far, or the total
                 number of scheduling operations performed by REX so far. Bit 2 
                 of the info_mask field determines which of the two meanings
                 applies.
	
  flags:
                 Bit [ 0 ] - interrupt state
                             1 - interrupts are locked
                             0 - interrupts are not locked
									
                 Bit [ 1 ] - suspend state
                             1 - task is suspended (by way of a request
                                 via rex_suspend_task)
                             0 - task is not suspended
									 
                 Bit [ 2 ] - slice type
                             0 - time_samples field contains the value of the
                                 slices field in the TCB. The slices field is a
                                 count of the number of times a task has been
                                 scheduled, and is a very rough measure of the
                                 CPU time allotted to a task.
                             1 - time_samples field contains more accurate profiling
                                 information generated by using a timer to
                                 measure how long the task has run. The bit is 0
                                 typically if the build does not have software task
                                 profiling turned on.

  app:        Field to distinguish multiple BLAST systems on the same
              target.
              0 - Modem SW
              1 - Modem FW
              2 - Multi Media

  special_task: Field to indicate profiling information not to related to
              regular tasks.
              0 - regular task
              1 - IDLE thread, consists of IDLE time of HW threads.

  task_id:    Unique identifier for the task or ISR. task_id is "-1" for
              special tasks.

  sp:         Same as LOG_TASKPROFILE_C

  sigs:       Same as LOG_TASKPROFILE_C

  wait:       Same as LOG_TASKPROFILE_C

  pri:        The value of the pri field from the task's TCB. This denotes
              the priority of the task.

  time_samples[x]: A measure of the HW thread time used by the task. This
              field contains the number of time samples during which this
              task was running on HW thread x, if this is available.  In
              otherwords, this field is set to the value of the "totalcycles"
              field in the TCB. Since HW thread x doesn't run on each core
              clock cycle, we need to divide it by 6 to get the TCYCLES.

  core_clk_freq: The frequency of Q6 core in MHz. This is the rate at which
              time samaples increment.

  total_samples: The total number of core cycles elapsed so far.

  total_sclk_samples: The total number of sleep clock ticks elapsed so far.
              Sleep clock runs at fixed frequency of 32768 Hz.
