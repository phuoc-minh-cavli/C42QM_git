                                USAGE
 
 The AOSTLM API allows features to access the AOSTLM Server, via a
 proxy or Remote Client for licensing.  Any feature that wishes to verify
 that a valid license has been installed may use this api to request
 permission to run.
 
 The client must connect to the AOSTLM Server before it is able to process
 requests.  It has three states of operation:
 
 STOPPED:       The client has not been started.  It is not connected, nor
                is it attempting to connect.
 CONNECTING:    The client has been started and is attempting to connect to
                the server.  
 CONNECTED      The client is connected to the server and may field access
                requests.
 
          +---------+
          | STOPPED |       CANNOT FIELD REQUESTS OF ANY TYPE
          +---------+
               |            On Boot platform initializes AOSTLM Client
               V
         +------------+
         | CONNECTING |     Client attempts to connect to Server. Delay may be long
         +------------+     
               |            Server connects to client
               V                
          +-----------+
          | CONNECTED |     Client may field access requests
          +-----------+
 
 It may take some time before the client connects to the server.  A request
 for access will not be granted until the server has connected.  Features have
 3 options:
 
 1.  Call aostlm_req_access.  If the server has connected, this operation will
     return a GRANT or DENY as appropriate.  If the server has not connected,
     the operation will block the calling thread until it does.
 
 2.  Poll.  aostlm_status returns the current state of the client.  Once
     CONNECTED, a feature may expect to call aostlm_req_access without blocking
 
 3.  Register a callback.  Features may register a callback through the
     aostlm_register_connected_callback operation.  If the Client has already
     connected to the server, the callback will be called ON THE REGISTERING
     THREAD CONTEXT, so be careful to avoid deadlock (don't leave a mutex locked
     when you call the register function that you also lock in the callback).
     If the client has not connected to the server, the callback will be called
     upon connection, at which point the feature may request access without
     blocking
