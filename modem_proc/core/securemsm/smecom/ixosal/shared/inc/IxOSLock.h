/**
@name OS ABSTRACTION LOCK MECHANISM
@{

   @brief
   The module APIs provide an operating system abstracted services
   to secureMSM components. The implementation provides an abstraction 
   layer over REX and Blast native lock mechanisms.

   @detail
   This module provides support for critical sections and interrupt lock
   for REX and only critical section for BLAST OS. IxOSLockEnumType defines 
   critical section and isr lock types. An object registry implementation 
   converts the normal unsigned int handle to corresponding native structures,
   This also keeps track of no of locks generated and type of locks for native 
   invocation.

   Mutexes:
   Mutexes are used to allow only one thread to enter the critical section
   of code that is accessing shared data. Thus, a given data structure which
   needs mutual exclusion will need to create a mutex to go with it. There
   will be three different types of mutexes created; one which is accessed from
   threads only, and another which is accessed between threads and the ISR, and
   another which defines critical sections using Rex.

   For the mutex accessed from threads only, context switching will be disabled
   if shared data is accessed between different processes - where one may
   not necessarily be the owner of (and thus not have full control of) the
   shared data structure. This is different from critical sections, where 
   context switching is still enabled (note that if a swapped in thread
   tries to access the shared resource critical section, it will suspend). 

   Description of Types of Locks
   1. OSLOCK_CRITICALSECTION_ONLY (REX, BLAST)
      Critical sections are used. Used to attempt to enter the critical section
      If successful, proceed to access the critical section. If not, the calling
      task will be suspended since the critical section is unavailable (already
      locked out), since context switching is still allowed. Interrupts can
      still occur. More efficient (much faster as far as lock times); use this
      mutex for all inter-thread synchronization. Critical sections are limited,
      however, since it cannot be shared across processes.

   2. OSLOCK_ISR_ONLY (REX only)
      Interrupt_Lock() is used to disable interrupts until after its subsequent call
      to os_MutexUnlock(). Context switching is still allowed. Used for mutex
      between thread and ISR.

   3. OSLOCK_TASK_ONLY  (REX only)
      Tasklock() is used to disable context switching until its subsequent
      call to os_MutexUnlock(). Processing stays within the current task while
      interrupts can still occur. Good to use for inter-process synchronization.
      Least efficient; use as a last resort.
