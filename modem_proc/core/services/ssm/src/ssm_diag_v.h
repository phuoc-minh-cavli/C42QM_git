               Diagnostic Packet Definitions for SSM

  Description: Packet definitions between the diagnostic subsystem
  and the external device.

  !!! NOTE: All member structures of diag packets must be PACKED.

  !!! WARNING: Each command code number is part of the externalized
  diagnostic command interface.  This number *MUST* be assigned
  by a member of QCT's tools development team.
