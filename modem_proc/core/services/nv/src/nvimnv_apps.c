DESCRIPTION

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  nv_cmd
    This is the applications read and write interface to the NV subsystem
    from the apps side, it calls the synchronous nv_cmd_remote() interface
    which makes an RPC call to the modem side where NV resides.
 
INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The RPC task must be up and running on the apps side and communication
  through RPC with the modem side must be established before this interface
  is used.

                   on the modem.

FUNCTION NV_CMD

DESCRIPTION
  This is the apps side's interface to the NV subsystem residing on the
  modem side. This function sets the status field of the cmd_ptr argument
  to NV_BUSY_S before calling the synchronous nv_cmd_remote() interface
  which makes an RPC call that results in an NV cmd being queued on the
  modem side to service the request. The RPC call returns once NV has
  finished its operation on the modem side.
  
DEPENDENCIES
  RPC communication must be established between the apps and modem sides
  before this interface is called.

RETURN VALUE
  None directly.  The status variable of the nv_cmd_type reflects the current
  status of this command as it is processed.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.
