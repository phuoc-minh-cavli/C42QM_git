/**

 *
 * This function is implemented by the appropriate sleep solver on a per-target
 * basis.  The ultimate goal of this function is to allocate the latency
 * budget, selecting the best set of low power modes that will fit into the
 * latency budget while simultaneously minimizing the power consumption of the
 * system. 
 *  
 * The caveat is this: the problem that this function attempts to solve in real
 * time is NP-complete; the problem is essentially a variant of the knapsack
 * problem.  That said, using this abstract "solver" interface we can come up
 * with multiple implementations of this function which trade off computational
 * complexity for exactness of solution as is appropriate for whatever target
 * the code happens to be running on at the time. 
 *  
 * Ultimately though, this function is really only of interest to the sleep
 * module, and anyone who thinks they need to call this external to the sleep
 * module should probably reconsider why they want to perform this (potentially
 * very expensive) calculation.
