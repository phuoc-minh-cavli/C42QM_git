@brief
  This function is used internally by DBT transaction object to determine the optimum 
  value to use for the radius parameter to be sent to the GM engine for the next geofence.
  Through performance tuning it was determined that in order to maintain the distance 
  traversed between position reports within + or - 15% of the minDistance specified by 
  the client the radius should be calculated as follows
  1. If speed is not valid or less than 1m/sec then
         1.1 Final radius is minDistance reduced by 15% of the minDistance so that we force GM to breach conservatively at the lower bound
           
  2. Else If speed is valid and above 1m sec
         2.1 Calculate the earliest time to the next breach based on the last speed reported. This is actually the whole second before
             or at which the next breach could happen
         2.2 Use this to calculate the estimated distance to this breach event
         2.3 Determine the undershoot radius by calculating the 85% threshold for the estimated distance
         2.4 Use this and speed to calculate the estimated time to breach the undershoot radius and round it up to the next second
             This is becuase we want to align our estimate to the GPS second boundary of position reports
         2.5 Determine the distance travelled to breach the undershoot radius using the estimated time from step 2.4
         2.5 We then evaluate the overshoot radius if we wait for one second after covering the undershoot radius. The idea is to
             not be too conservative and relax our radius constraint if we can still remain within the 115% upper bound
         2.6 If the overshoot radius is lesser than the 115% upper bound we choose the overshoot radius or the undershoot radius
  3. For both cases the radius needs to be reduced by 2m to account for integer arithmetic being exclusively used in GM for radius 
     calculations wherein a few meters maybe lost in round off errors.
