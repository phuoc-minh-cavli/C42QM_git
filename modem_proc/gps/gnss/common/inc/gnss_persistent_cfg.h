                  GNSS Persistent Configurable Parameter Module

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

  This file defines the API to be used to read/write GNSS Persistent
  Configurable Parameter blocks.  These blocks are similar to "NV" parameters
  but they can't be viewed or modified by QXDM and thus they are easier
  to manage and maintain.  The code is far simpler as well.

/*
 *  NV parameters are broken up into 3 blocks:
 *    RUNTIME_MODIFIED_PARAMETER -
 *                    This block contains parameters that are
 *                    actively modified by the software at runtime and 
 *                    stored back to persistent memory at the end of a session
 *                    or at system shutdown.  External tools should never
 *                    modify this block by directly writing to the file
 *                    system, since that can interfere with the operation
 *                    of the embedded software.
 *    PRIVATE_PARAMETER - 
 *                    This block contains "algorithm tuning" parameters
 *                    that are read from persistent memory at bootup
 *                    and never changed at runtime.  They can be configured
 *                    by writing to persistent memory with an external tool
 *                    but the change does not take effect until the next reboot.
 *    PUBLIC_PARAMETER -  
 *                    This block contains "algorithm tuning" parameters
 *                    that are read from persistent memory at bootup, but
 *                    may be changed at runtime via QMI messages.  External
 *                    tools must never attempt to change these parameters
 *                    by writing directly to the file system because those
 *                    changes will be overwritten by the embedded SW which
 *                    writes any changes to the file system (made through
 *                    QMI commands) at the end of each session or at
 *                    graceful shutdown of the modem.
 *
 *  These 3 blocks will be stored in 3 separate files.  Each block must
 *  be read/written as a whole.
 *
 *  The following enumeration type is used to select the particular block.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                             HOW TO USE THIS API
 *
 *  The parameter block is free form and without limits (other than a 64KB
 *  limit in size).  In spite of this, it is strongly recommended that
 *  the parameter block be designed such that it can accommodate changes
 *  in the future without breaking backward compatibility.  There are numerous
 *  ways to achieve this, including the use of TLV's, version numbers, etc.
 *  The simplest solution is probably just to use a version number to
 *  denote changes that break backward compatibility.
 *
 *  The recommendation made by the author of this API is that the
 *  user's parameter buffer start with a version number pair consisting of
 *  a major version number and a minor version number.  The major version
 *  number would be incremented only when there is a change that breaks
 *  backward compatibility.  The minor number would be changed for any
 *  backward compatible change.  The major and minor version numbers should
 *  probably start with 1 and 0 respectively.  All tools which read the
 *  parameters from non-volatile storage (including embedded software and
 *  external tools) should be designed to properly handle the case of
 *  version number changes.
