  This item indicates eAMR mode change detection is enabled.

  @comment
  The caller must assume that eAMR mode change detection is disabled by default

  When the voicecfg item is set to TRUE, eAMR mode change detection is enabled.

  Voice Driver clients can call the voice configuration API to determine 
  if eAMR mode change detection is enabled or not. This feature allows the 
  OEM to control the sample rate of their external voice pre-post processing
  module based on eAMR mode change notification.
