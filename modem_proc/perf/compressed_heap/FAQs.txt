How to enable/integrate Compressed Heap?

* The module that would use the compressed heap should do following.
	* include "compressed_modem_mem.h" file in the source code where the compressed heap APIs are being used.
	* In the build scons of the module - add following
	   env.RequirePublicApi(['COMPRESSED_HEAP', ], area='PERF')
* If this is first time to integrate the compressed heap feature in any build. 
	* Get/Sync the corresponding perf.mpss.xxxx component.
	* in the target.builds file -- add following at appropriate places. (target.builds is part of config.mpss.xxxx component)
			define COMPRESSED_MODEM_MEM_HEAP_SIZE <appropriate size> (e.g. 0x0200000)
			define FEATURE_COMPRESSED_HEAP
	* in appropriate compress_rw.lst, add following at appropriate location (compress_rw.lst is part of config.mpss.xxxxx component)
			*modem_proc/perf/compressed_heap*:(.data .data.*) 
			and
			*modem_proc/perf/compressed_heap*:(*COMMON .bss .bss.* .bss.*.*) 
			
How to disable already integrated Compressed Heap Feature?

	Its easy! Do Following.
	* Comment out all the occurances of following lines from target.builds.
			define COMPRESSED_MODEM_MEM_HEAP_SIZE 0xYYYYYYYYYY
			define FEATURE_COMPRESSED_HEAP
	* Comment out following lines from all applicable compress_rw.lst file.
	        *modem_proc/perf/compressed_heap*:(.data .data.*) 
			and
			*modem_proc/perf/compressed_heap*:(*COMMON .bss .bss.* .bss.*.*) 
			
What will happen if someone forgets to put lines in compress_rw.lst or if compress_rw.lst is missing but feature flags are defined in target.builds file?
	
		Code will still execute. But only one thing --- there won't be any compression and it will be as good as another normal heap.
	

How will I debug the issues in compressed heap?
		Same "heapwalker.cmm" script will work for compressed heap as well. Just execute like below:
		
		do heapwalker.cmm compressed_mem_heap
