/**
  @brief Send an RR_CELL_ACQ_IMSG_START_IND to the RR cell acquisition state
         machine.

  @param target_cell:   The ARFCN of the cell to acquire.

  @param RXLEV_average: The RXLEV of the target cell, used to calculate C1 in
  the case of non-immediate reselection.

  @param recent_reselection_flag: Boolean value indicating if a reselection has
  recently occurred.  Used to apply hysteresis when determining cell
  suitability for non-immediate reselection.

  @param rr_cell_acq_cause: Indicates the method of selection or reselection
  that should be used when acquiring the new cell.

  @param sync_flag: Indicates whether the target cell is in the 'sync cell'
  list.  TRUE if it is (but only if the cell acq cause is for a non-immediate
  reselection), FALSE otherwise.

  @param clear_si_database: Flag to indicate whether or not the RR cell
  acquisition state machine should clear the system information database it
  is told to use.
 
  @param gprs_cell_info: Pointer to the gprs system information
  database that the RR cell acquisition database should
  reference when performing it's acquisition.

  @param requested_plmn Pointer to the current requested PLMN.  May be set
         to NULL if not available.
