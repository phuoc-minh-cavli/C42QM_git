  messages of the already selected cell. 
  Note: It is assumed that L1 is already tuned to the cell (i.e. L1 has just 
  left dedicated state, or a MPH_SELECT_SPECIFIC_BCCH_REQ has previously been 
  sent) and SIs are being reaed. If this is not the case, then use 
  RR_SELECT_BCCH_IMSG_SELECT_REQ instead. 
  
  @param arfcn 
  @param rxlev_average 
  @param bsic                 BSIC of the selected cell 
  @param cell_suitable_cb_fn  Call-back function to be called when SI3 is 
                              received. If this call-back returns FALSE, then
                              the cell is deemed not suitable and a fail
                              indication will be output. 
                              Set to NULL if not required.
  @see rr_cell_suitable_cb_fn_t 
  @param early_camp_required  Whether early camping is required 
  @param notify_on_si_mask    When the indicated SIs have been received, a 
                              notification indication is sent out (but this
                              does not stop the procedure).
                              Set to NULL if not required.
  @param wait_for_si_mask     When the indicated SIs have been received, the 
                              procedure completes. This can be set to
                              MASK_SI_NONE, but if early camping based on SI3
                              is required, then this is internally modified to
                              add SI3
  @param init_params_ptr      Initial paramters (optional).
                              Set to NULL if not required.
  @param max_allowed_time_ms  Maximum allowed time (in millisecs) for the acquisition. Set to 0 if not 
                              required (i.e. the caller will run a timer)
