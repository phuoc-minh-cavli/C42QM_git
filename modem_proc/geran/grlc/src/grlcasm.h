===
===  FUNCTION      GRLC_DL_ASSEMBLE
===
===  DESCRIPTION
===
===    Assemble the downlink data block in ack mode or un-ack mode into
===    one or more pdus. When a complete pdu is formed it is sent off to
===    LLC and a new pdu is created for the next assembly.
===
===    When a pdu exceeds its 1536 octets limit, it is truncated and sent 
===    off. A flag is set to ensure subsequent data blocks are discarded
===    until one containing a pdu boundary (with ext octet). The data 
===    following the pdu boundary will then be assembled into pdus again.
===
===    This fn should be called when a dl data block is ready in cur_dl_blk.
===    In ack mode, another shell fn should call this function.
===
===  PARAMETERS
===
===    blk_ptr: points to an internal DL data block which could be the
===             current dl block or a filled block in un-ack mode or an
===             element of the DL array in ack mode.
===
===  DEPENDENCIES
===
===    cur_dl_pdu: input dl data block
===    cur_dl_pdu: current working pdu which may contain a partial pdu
===    or empty.
===
===    When this function is called cur_dl_blk is expected to hold a data 
===    block whose BSN is contiguous with the one before.
===
===  RETURN VALUE
===
===    none

===  SIDE EFFECTS
