** This 16-bit counter is incremented by PL1 every block period during uplink
** transfer. This is used to find the period between a block being confirmed as 
** transmitted by PL1 and when a packet uplink acknack is received.
** If the lapsed period is less than the expression (MAX(BS_CV_MAX,1)-1) then
** a '0' or Negative acknowledgement in the bitmap is disregarded.
**
** Ac = block counter value when receiving packet uplink acknack
** Bc = block counter value after block is transmitted
** expr = MAX(BS_CV_MAX,1)-1
**
** Disregard NACK if Ac - Bc < expr or,
**                if Ac < Bc + expr
** Inversely, NACK if Ac >= Bc + expr
**
** So after a block is confirmed as transmitted by PL1 the current value of 
** grlc_ul_block_counter plus 'expr' is assigned to that block. Determination of
** NACK later on will only involve a simple (even modulo) comparison

===
===    This function sends a radio block to the RLC UL-PL1 FIFO if the FIFO

===    sending. After segmentation each data block has its 'dsm_ptr' variable
===    pointing at the payload. If it sent out for the 1st time (PTX) then a 
===    duplicate of the payload is made and stored in dup_dsm_ptr for translating
===    into straight memory in the FIFO. After translation the dup_dsm_ptr is
===    freed. When a (PACK or NACK) block is re-transmitted another dup is made
===    again.
===
===    The status of the block being transmitted is not updated until the block
===    is confirmed as transmitted by the DSP (in post_tx_actions())
===
===    In un-ack mode, no blocks are re-transmitted unless it has CV = 0. So for
===    block with CV=0 we make a dup as per usual. For all other blocks we transfer

===
===  DESCRIPTION
===
===    This function sends a radio block to the RLC UL-PL1 FIFO if the FIFO
===    is not full. All the fields in the RLC header are updated prior to 
===    sending. Each data block carries its payload in 'dsm_ptr' after being 
===    segmented. A dup is made and used up (dup_dsm_ptr) on every transmission
===    and retransmission. Therefore the dup_dsm_ptr is transient and it is freed
===    after a transmission where as the dsm_ptr remains until a block is acknowledged.
===    The status of the block being transmitted is not updated until the block
===    is confirmed as transmitted by the DSP (in post_tx_actions())
===
===    In un-ack mode, no blocks are re-transmitted unless it has CV = 0. So for
