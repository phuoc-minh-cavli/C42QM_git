 Compressed packet format:

 The first octet contains the packet type (top 3 bits), TCP
 'push' bit, and flags that indicate which of the 4 TCP sequence
 numbers have changed (bottom 5 bits).  The next octet is a
 conversation number that associates a saved IP/TCP header with
 the compressed packet.  The next two octets are the TCP checksum
 from the original datagram.  The next 0 to 15 octets are
 sequence number changes, one change per bit set in the header
 (there may be no changes and there are two special cases where
 the receiver implicitly knows what changed -- see below).

 There are 5 numbers which can change (they are always inserted
 in the following order): TCP urgent pointer, window,
 acknowlegement, sequence number and IP ID.  (The urgent pointer
 is different from the others in that its value is sent, not the
 change in value.)  Since typical use of SLIP links is biased
 toward small packets (see comments on MTU/MSS below), changes
 use a variable length coding with one octet for numbers in the
 range 1 - 255 and 3 octets (0, MSB, LSB) for numbers in the
 range 256 - 65535 or 0.  (If the change in sequence number or
 ack is more than 65535, an uncompressed packet is sent.)

 Packet types (must not conflict with IP protocol version)

 The top nibble of the first octet is the packet type.  There are
 three possible types: IP (not proto TCP or tcp with one of the
 control flags set); uncompressed TCP (a normal IP/TCP packet but
 with the 8-bit protocol field replaced by an 8-bit connection id --
 this type of packet syncs the sender & receiver); and compressed
 TCP (described above).

 LSB of 4-bit field is TCP "PUSH" bit (a worthless anachronism) and
 is logically part of the 4-bit "changes" field that follows.  Top
 three bits are actual packet type.  For backward compatibility
 and in the interest of conserving bits, numbers are chosen so the
 IP protocol version number (4) which normally appears in this nibble
 means "IP packet".
