/**
   @file pstimer.h
   @brief This is the source file for managing the API timers. The implementation is
  a standard delta list.
 */

/*
INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  ps_timer_init() MUST be called before any other timer functions are
  called.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  Initialization functions:
    -  ps_timer_tick_init(tick_timer_cb_type *timer_cb_ptr): Initialize
       the Tick Timer that is used to tick other API timers.

  API Functions to be called by applications using Timer:
    1) ps_timer_alloc():      Function to allocate a timer from free pool.
    2) ps_timer_start():      Start the timer using milliseconds
    3) ps_timer_start_secs(): Start the timer using seconds
    4) ps_timer_cancel():     Cancel the timer
    5) ps_timer_free() :      Free the timer
    6) ps_timer_is_running:   Returns if the timer is running or not.

  PS Task to Timer API interface functions:
    1) ps_timer_start_tick: Starts the tick timer
    2) ps_timer_cancel_tick: Cancels the tick timer.
    3) ps_timer_handler: Function to be executed every time the tick
       timer expires.

when        who    what, where, why
--------    ---    ---------------------------------------------------------- 
11/28/11    sun    To fix documentation issue 
08/28/11    SCD    (Tech Pubs) Applied new Doxygen grouping markup.
12/01/10    SCD    (Tech Pubs) Edited Doxygen markup and comments.
12/01/10    sa     Modified the comments according to doxygen specific 
                   semantics.
01/11/10    ss     Lint warning fixes.  
02/19/09    ar     Added PS_TIMER_FREE()
12/14/08    pp     Common Modem Interface: Public/Private API split.
05/10/06    mct    Now using a random cookie value for timers.
04/22/06    mct    Reworked entire PS timer library to use new timer.h API.
                   Removed all old pstimer tick functionality. Implemented
                   callback mechanism to support extended timers through
                   REX timers.
03/21/05    ssh    Changes pursuant to the new typedef ps_timer_handle_type
10/26/04    ifk    Replaced reassembly timer with fraghdl timers
10/25/04    msr    Increase number of timers per TCB from 4 to 5 to include
                   persist timer.
06/16/04    mvl    changed the timers to use an int64 rather than an int32 to
                   support IPv6 prefix lifetimes.  Also added
                   ps_timer_start_secs() macro allowing timers to be started
                   in seconds (rather than milli seconds.
04/30/04    usb    Added timers for IP reassembly, include file cleanup.
04/28/04    mct    Increased # of sockets timers to account for extra TCBs.
06/11/03    jd     Added ps_timer_remaining to check time left on timer
05/04/03    ss     Increased PS_TIMER_SOCKET_TIMERS to account for timer
                   needed to support SO_LINGER socket option
11/06/02    ifk    Included dssdns.h and incremented PS timers for DNS.
10/08/02    aku    Removed FEATURE_DATA_MM featurization.
09/10/02    mvl    fixed number of timers used for PPP.
08/13/02    mvl    Fixed MM featurization.
08/04/02    mvl    Simplified MM featurization.
08/01/02    usb    Merged in changes for multimode ps under FEATURE_DATA_MM
07/12/02    jd     Added pvcs header tag to edit history
06/06/02    jd     Keep track of elapsed ms instead of ticks, since timer
                   might expire much later than one tick (50ms) as seen in
                   the case of dormancy/mobile ip reregistration.
03/13/02    pjb    There are 4 timers per TCB now not 3.
01/25/02    ss     Increased the maximum timers to 8 to account for the timer
                   used by DNS
07/27/01    mvl    Added 4 extra timers for LCP and IPCP: 2 for each iface
06/07/01    jd     Modified the time argument to ps_start_timer() to a sint31
                   so that longer times can be specified.
05/18/01  mvl/na   Changed the way the max timers is defined to more cleanly
                   support multiple features.
02/06/01    snn    Modified the code to use the clock services instead of
                   maintaining the timer. This ensures that the timer is
                   more accurate. (specially since PS task has very low
                   priority).
11/27/00    na     Cleanup. Moved timer_entry_type to pstimer.c
11/02/00    snn    Kept PS_TIMER_MAX in #define for FEATURE_DS_SOCKETS
                   Initialized PS_TIMER_FREE to zero. This allows us to
                   memset the timer structure.
                   Deleted unwanted defines from ps_timer_error_type
09/11/00   snn/na  created module
