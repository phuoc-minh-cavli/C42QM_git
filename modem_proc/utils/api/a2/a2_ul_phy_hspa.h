    - Writes the task to set the HARQ_DONE register associated with a given bank
      - This is done to make sure that HW can catch SW Late in building TX PDUs
    - Writes Tag and Interrupt Task if 'interrupt_reqd' is set to TRUE
      - This is needed to call the registered call back function after all the
        tasks written since the last commit executed successfully
    - commits the write pointer to trigger A2 to start working on written TASKs

  This function is expected to be successful otherwise it will throw an error
  fatal (which can be used to fine tune TASK Q size)
