DESCRIPTION:
  RPMh Command Services APIs

  This is the main interface for issuing commands to RPMh. It will be used by
  resource owners who need to issue commands to RPMh HW. It interacts with 
  RSC hardware underneath to facilitate RPMh commands to the proper RPMh HW 
  block. The driver stores each command locally and synchronizes the desired 
  state with the state at RPMh.

  Commands can be issued either as fire-and-forget or as completion. In order
  to confirm a command has been applied at the HW, commands must be issued as
  completion, AND an rpmh_barrier API must be called (which blocks until the
  command(s) have finished).

  This interface also provides sleep interaction to prepare for entering and 
  exiting sleep. This is necessary to configure the RSC TSC contents as desired
  by clients.
