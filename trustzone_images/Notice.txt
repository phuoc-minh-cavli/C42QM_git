"SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
     _D_l_g works...  we think.  There is no implicit guarantee of
     anything.  We reserve no legal rights to the software known
     as the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS) - PCCTS
     is in the public domain.  An individual or company may do
     whatever they wish with source code distributed with PCCTS
     or the code generated by PCCTS, including the incorporation
     of PCCTS, or its output, into commercial software.  We
     encourage users to develop software with PCCTS.  However, we
     do ask that credit is given to us for developing PCCTS.  By
     ""credit"", we mean that if you incorporate our source code
     into one of your programs (commercial product, research pro-
     ject, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere
     in the documentation, research report, etc...  If you like
     PCCTS and have developed a nice tool with the output, please
     mention that you developed it using PCCTS.  As long as these
     guidelines are followed, we expect to continue enhancing
     this system and expect to make other tools available as they
     are completed."

= Code Contributions =
======================

To make a contribution to a TianoCore project, follow these steps.
1. Create a change description in the format specified below to
   use in the source control commit log.
2. Your commit message must include your ""Signed-off-by"" signature,
   and ""Contributed-under"" message.
3. Your ""Contributed-under"" message explicitly states that the
   contribution is made under the terms of the specified
   contribution agreement.  Your ""Contributed-under"" message
   must include the name of contribution agreement and version.
   For example: Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement 1.0
   The ""TianoCore Contribution Agreement"" is included below in
   this document.
4. Submit your code to the TianoCore project using the process
   that the project documents on its web page.  If the process is
   not documented, then submit the code on development email list
   for the project.
5. It is preferred that contributions are submitted using the same
   copyright license as the base project. When that is not possible,
   then contributions using the following licenses can be accepted:
   * BSD (2-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
   * BSD (3-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
   * MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
   * Python-2.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/Python-2.0
   * Zlib: http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib

   Contributions of code put into the public domain can also be
   accepted.

   Contributions using other licenses might be accepted, but further
   review will be required.

=======================================
