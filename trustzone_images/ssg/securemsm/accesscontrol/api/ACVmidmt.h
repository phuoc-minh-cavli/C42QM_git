/* 9x35, 9x45 IPA VMID need special care as per below description from IPA h/w team.
 **
 ** IPA uC handles power collapse save and restore producer. Without XPU and VMIDMT 
 ** retention capability in Elessar IPA uC restores their state. 
 ** This means that uC firmware could use any VMID value (by reprogramming the VMIDMT).
 ** Thus security team required that IPA HW always sets VMID bit 4 as high so that it will
 ** not be able to use ‘regular’ system VMIDs. (same IPA impl was carried over to 9x45)
