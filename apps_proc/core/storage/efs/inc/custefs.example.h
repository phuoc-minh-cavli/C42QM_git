/*
 * There are optional FS Diag commands to execute certain benchmark
 * tests on-target and report timing measurements from the filesystem
 * and underlying devices.  This is useful to characterize performance
 * of the filesystem and block devices, independent of any data
 * transport.
 *
 * This feature is intended ONLY for engineering/debug builds, since
 * the Benchmark commands allow unsecured file access.  They can also
 * be used to perform destructive or disabling operations.
 *
 * Enable only in Engineering builds.  No produciton build should ever
 * define this.
 */

/*
 * Enable support for "CEFS" (Canonical EFS) images, which are
 * factory-programmed into NAND.
 *
 * If this feature is not defined, CEFS images will be ignored.

 * If this feature is defined, EFS will check for a CEFS image at
 * startup and unpack it into an EFS2 filesystem if found.

 * To facilitate factory NAND programming, Diag can be used to extract
 * a Canonical EFS image (CEFS) from a running phone.  This image
 * contains ALL filesystem data, including protected or hidden data.
 * The image can be programmed into NAND memory during factory
 * production to reproduce an exact filesystem across multiple phones,
 * even with different bad-block maps.
 *
 * Since this feature allows unrestricted access to ALL files via
 * Diag, it presents an ENORMOUS SECURITY RISK and must never be
 * enabled in production/customer builds.  Only the 'reference phone'
 * should have this feature defined in a special build.
 *
 * NOTE: Because CEFS extraction locks the filesystem during the
 * entire process (for consistency), all tasks may be blocked from
 * executing.  This can cause software watchdog resets during the CEFS
 * process.  For this reason, the special build flag
 * NO_DOG
 * must also be defined for CEFS-enabled builds to disable the
 * software watchdog.

  EFS2 Configuration Overrides

 * it increases the size of the buffer pool to hold the data of the larger

 * buffers large enough to use this, there is a slight performance gain.
 * It offers no benefits to any existing applications, and therefore should
 * normally be disabled. */

 * EFS configurations this setting can have a tolerance of just 1 bad block
 * which is not desirable since sometimes factory will ship with more bad
 * blocks or weak blocks that could get bad in that region. So set this

 * increase comes with a penalty of lost usable EFS space.

 * All new code should use the EFS2 API efs_xxx(), but since there is
 * still a large body of code using EFS1 calls fs_xxx(), this feature
 * should be enabled on most builds.  Also, the files in
 * MSMSHARED_FS_COMPAT VU is required for this feature.
