GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This module contains procedures to convert seconds to and from Julian
  calendar units.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: The time calculations in this module are only valid for
  dates and times from 6 Jan 1988, 00:00:00 to 28 Feb 2100, 23:59:59.  This
  is due to the fact that this module assumes that all years evenly divisible
  by 4 are leap years. Unfortunately, century years (e.g., 1900, 2000, 2100)
  must also be evenly divisible by 400 in order to be leap years, and so the
  year 2100 does not qualify as a leap year.


EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  time_jul_from_secs
    This function converts a specified number of elapsed seconds since
    the base date to its equivalent Julian date and time.

  time_jul_to_secs
    This function converts a specified Julian date and time to an
    equivalent number of elapsed seconds since the base date.


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  None.
