 * DAL_RPM_CONFIG_SET_ACTIVE_0, is considered the "primary" set.  When a driver
 * on the RPM is evaluating whether enough resources are available to satisfy
 * a request, the resources are available only if the primary requests from all
 * other masters allow for it.  Thus, the primary request for a given resource
 * should always be the "most intensive" request, to assure that requests to
 * other sets can be satisfied.
 *
 * Additionally, if a set other than the primary set becomes active, but no
 * request has been set up for a resource in that set, the set inherits the
 * current request configured for that resource in the primary set. */

/***********************************
 *         Trigger Config          *
 ***********************************/
/* Triggers are the mechanism used to switch between configuration sets.  There
 * are two basic kinds of triggers: interrupt-based triggers, and timer-based
 * triggers.
 *
 * 
 * == Interrupt-Based Triggers ==
 *
 * Interrupt-based triggers are set and cleared through the SetTrigger and
 * ClearTrigger functions below.  Their last parameter is a
 * DAL_rpm_InterruptType which represents the mask of all interrupts that
 * can potentially be supported by the RPM for triggering.
 *
 * Issuing one of these requests will basically send a request to the RPM
 * to set up the trigger.  The RPM can deny the trigger request for 3 possible
 * reasons:
 *   1) The interrupt being requested is an interrupt that the requesting
 *      master does not have permission to monitor.  Even though all possible
 *      interrupts are represented by the InterruptType, the RPM will filter
 *      the requested trigger interrupts so that security is maintained.
 *
 *   2) The interrupt being requested cannot be used to service the transition
 *      between the requested sets.  For example, an interrupt that is mapped
 *      to the MPM can only be used for a transition from the sleep set to an
 *      active set--since the RPM doesn't have the interrupt mapped directly,
 *      it cannot be used for an active set to active set transition.
 *
 *   3) The interrupt is not supported by this version of the RPM.
 *
 *
 * == Timer-Based Triggers ==
 *
 * Timer-based triggers are set and cleared through the SetTimedTrigger
 * function.  The last parameter is a uint32 representing the duration of the
 * timer, in units of slow clock ticks (32768 Hz).  Thus, the minimum time is
 * 1 sclk (about 30.5 us) and the maximum time is 0xFFFFFFFF sclks (about
 * 131,072 s or 36.4 hours).  To clear a TimedTrigger, 'set' the trigger with
 * a duration of '0'.
 *
 * When something causes the RPM to transition to the set represented by the
 * FromSet of the timed trigger, the timer will start.  If no other event
 * causes a transition away from FromSet before the timer duration expires,
 * then the RPM will transition this master to ToSet.  If the master
 * transitions away from FromSet before the timer expires, the timer is
 * cancelled and restarted the next time FromSet is reached.
 *
 *
 * == Config Set Wildcards ==
 *
 * Interrupt-based trigger functions accept DAL_RPM_CONFIG_SET_INVALID as a
 * wildcard to either the FromSet or ToSet parameters (but not both at the
 * same time).
 *
 * If the invalid set is passed as the FromSet parameter and your trigger is
 * accepted, then any time that interrupt is received it will transition your
 * master to ToSet, regardless of which set it was currently in.
 *
 * If the invalid set is passed as the ToSet parameter and your trigger is
 * accepted, then whenever your trigger fires it will cause a transition to
 * the previous *active* (not sleep) set that your master had selected.  That
 * language is hard to parse, so here's an example:
 *
 * [Master's state] <-- [Set a wildcarded ToSet would transition to]:
 *   - Active Set 0 <-- Active Set 0 (since there's no "history")
 *   - Active Set 2 <-- Active Set 0
 *   - Active Set 1 <-- Active Set 2
 *   - Active Set 4 <-- Active Set 1
 *   - Sleep Set    <-- Active Set 4
 *   - Active Set 0 <-- Active Set 4 (sleep set is ignored by wildcarded ToSet)
 *   - Active Set 1 <-- Active Set 0
 *
 *
 * == Wakeup Interrupts ==
 *
 * Wildcarding the ToSet parameter can be very useful for simply flagging an
 * interrupt as a "wakeup" interrupt.  For example, if you wanted to have
 * the USB interrupt wake your master from sleep you could do
 *
 *   DAL_rpm_InterruptType triggers = {0};
 *   triggers.u.bits.USB = 1;
 *   SetTrigger(<handle>, SLEEP_SET, INVALID_SET, triggers);
 *
 * That way, if the USB interrupt occurs while your master is sleeping, your
 * master will automatically be transitioned back to its previously active set.
