when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ---------------------------------------------------------- 
08/02/13   sr      Added support for extended event APIs
05/22/10   sg      Doxygenated the file 
09/30/09   as      Removed inclusion of customer.h  
08/05/09   JV      Removed the CUST_H featurization around the inclusion of 
                   customer.h.
06/22/09   mad     Featurized inclusion of customer.h
06/11/09   JV      Featurized inclusion of customer.h to ease merging of the 
                   Q6 branch
12/02/08   mad     Took out internal functions and those not needed 
                   for stream driver model.
01/02/08   mad     Added extern "C" modifiers for function declarations
05/14/04   eav     Added FEATURE_SAVE_DEBUG_TRACE.  Added the function
                   event_save_circ_buffer_to_efs, which is called from err.c
04/17/01   lad     Moved constants to diagtune.h.
                   Moved event definitions to event_defs.h.
02/23/01   lad     Updated API for core diagnostics service.
11/17/00   jal     Bit fields in event_id_type came out in inverted order
                   from what we wanted.  Fixed.
11/13/00   lcc     Added event and type definitions for some events.
11/10/00   lad     Made obsolete event_report_data() a macro to NULL.
11/09/00   jal     Took the old event IDs out (again!)
11/07/00   jal     Renamed event_extra_data_type to event_payload_type
10/17/00   jal     Changes for new event accumulation mechanism
05/15/00   lad     Changed truncated timsteamp from uint32 to uint16.
04/11/00   lad     Increased # of customer reserved event IDs to 0x100.
12/16/99   lad     Added support for event reporting service.
01/21/99   lad     Created file.

@details
Static events are reported by the mobile device to indicate actions, such as state changes and
configuration, which are directly related to the operating standards of the system.
The intent is to provide a reporting mechanism that minimizes resource usage (in
particular, bandwidth) and maximizes storage and transmission priority for operating
information that is considered most important in software test and verification.

   @brief 
   Report an event without payload data . Similar to event_report() except that this function can take
   additional parameters - version and void * to specify additional information regarding where the event
   is being generated.

   @param[in] event_id                 ID of the event to be reported.Event IDs are defined in event_defs.h
   @param[in] version                  Specifies the version - currently, there are two versions 
                                       0 - same as event_report() (for backwards compatibility)
                                       1 - The outgoing event report header will have support to
                                           include ID field to differentiate the events coming
                                           from different instances of the processor.
   @param[in] *parameter               Based on the version passed in, this pointer is interpreted
                                       as follows-

                                                      is the ID of the instance generating this event.
