// Enable this feature to enable the memutils version of new and delete

// Enable this feature to have new and delete call HeapCache::GetBuffer and
// HeapCahce::ReturnBuffer.  HeapCache::GetBuffer and HeapCache::ReturnBuffer
// will call malloc and free when the heap cache is not enabled.  However,
// even when the heap cache is disabled, the heap cache code still adds 
// overhead bytes to each malloc operation, and provides memory overwrite 
// checking (memory overwrite checking requires that 
// FEATURE_MEMUTILS_HEAP_CACHE_ENHANCED_DEBUGGING be enabled).
// The feature requires that FEATURE_MEMUTILS_NEW_DELETE be enabled as well.
//#define FEATURE_MEMUTILS_NEW_DELETE_HEAP_CACHE

// Enable this feature to track memory leaks
// Then call memory_tracker_initialize() to start tracking leaks.
// and memory_tracker_terminate() to write a leak report to memleakn.txt 
// (where n is the number of times initialize and terminate are called).
//#define FEATURE_MEMUTILS_MEMORY_TRACKING

// Enable this feature to automatically print a leak report to memleaksX.txt
// in the EFS root directory when memory_tracker_terminate is called.  
// memory_tracker_terminate is called from HeapCache::Release when 
// FEATURE_MEMUTILS_MEMORY_TRACKING is enabled.  X is an index that is 
// incremented each time the leak reports are printed during a single session.
// If this feature is disabled, you may still call memory_tracker_leak_report 
// manually to print out a leak report.
//#define FEATURE_MEMUTILS_LEAK_REPORT

// Enable this feature to increase heap cache debbugging information
// This will slightly increase both memory usage and the time
// it takes to get and return heap cache memory buffers
// Enahanced debugging capabilities include:
// 1) A simplified version of the memory tracker:
//    a) A simplified, and faster version of memory leak tracking.
//    b) Current and peak memory usage information.
// 2) Improved memory overwrite checking (can report the file and line number)
//    where the offending buffer was allocated.
//#define FEATURE_MEMUTILS_HEAP_CACHE_ENHANCED_DEBUGGING

// Enable this feature to automatically call HeapCacheLeakReport when HeapCache::Release 
// is called.  If this feature is disabled, you may still call HeapCacheLeakReport 
// manually to print out a leak report.  This feature requires that 
// FEATURE_MEMUTILS_HEAP_CACHE_ENHANCED_DEBUGGING is enabled
//#define FEATURE_MEMUTILS_HEAP_CACHE_LEAK_REPORT

// Enable this feature to collect and print out heap usage statistics.
// This will track the number of buffers allocated/cached for each 
// cache bin, then print the statistics to the file heapcacheusageX.txt
// in the EFS root directory, where X is an index that is incremented 
// each time the usage statistics are printed during a single session
