@brief
Implements time-keeping functions using the slow clock.

Timer groups are a way of enabling and disabling groups of timers at the same time. This is
 mainly used by the sleep subsystem to disable unwanted timers during sleep. For this reason, one
 should be careful which group their timer is set in, to help conserve power. 
 
When timer's are active, they live on the active list. When deactivated, they are moved to their appropriate timer group.
When a timer group is re-enabled, they are spooled back onto the active list. Timers that were pending expire once,
 while recurring ones get bumped to the future.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

timer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

timer_def() must be called, or the TIMER_DEF( ) macro used, for each timer, 
before other timer functions are used with that timer.

A valid sclk estimate is needed before timers can be set.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  Implements time-keeping functions using the slow clock.

  Slow Clock Frequency          Granularity     Timer Range
    30.000kHz (lower limit)      33.3 us         39.7 hrs
    32.768kHz (nominal freq)     30.5 us         36.4 hrs
    60.000kHz (upper limit)      16.6 us         19.8 hrs


REGIONAL FUNCTIONS

  timer_init()
    Initializes the timer subsytem.  Call only from time_init( ).

  timer_set_modem_app_sclk_offset(delta)
    Sets the modem/app sclk counter difference.  Call only from timetick.c


EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  timer_def(timer, group, tcb, sigs, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer.
    Timers may also be staticly declared via the TIMER_DEF() macro

  timer_def2(timer, group, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer, with the clock callback semantics.
    Timers may also be staticly declared via the TIMER_DEF2() macro

  timer_set(timer, ticks, reload, unit)
    Sets an inactive timer to expire after a given period of time, or changes
    an active timer to expire after a given period of time.
    Optionally, specifies the timer to repeatly expire with a given period.

  timer_get(timer, unit)
    Get number of ticks before timer expires

  timer_pause(timer)
    Suspends an active timer

  timer_resume(timer)
    Resumes a previously "paused" active timer.

  timer_clr(timer, unit)
    Stops an active timer

  timer_clr_task_timers(tcb)
    Stops all active timers which belong to the specified task.

  timer_group_enable(timer_group)
    Enables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group which expired during the
    diabled period will have their expiry processing executed.

  timer_group_disable(timer_group)
    Disables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group will continue to count
    down, but they will not expire.


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

    timer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

    timer_def() must be called, or the TIMER_DEF( ) macro used, for each
      timer, before other timer functions are used with that timer.

    A valid sclk estimate is needed before timers can be set.
