/**
 * @brief Opens a file.
 *
 * This function opens a file pointed by <b>path</b> and associates an stream
 * with it.
 * The argument <b>mode</b> points to a string which starts with the following:
 * - <tt> r rb </tt>    Open a file for reading.
 * - <tt> w wb wu </tt>    Truncate to zero length or create a file for
 *                           writing.
 * - <tt> a ab a </tt>    Append. Open or create the file if it does not
 *                           exists for writing at the end of file.
 * - <tt> r+ rb+ r+b </tt> Open the file for update. The stream
 *                           is positioned at the beginning.
 * - <tt> w+ wb+ w+b wu+ w+u </tt> Create the file if it does not exist,
 *                            otherwise it is truncated to zero length.
 * - <tt> a+ ab+ a+b </tt> Append. Creates the file if it does
 *                            not exist. Reads happen at the beginning of the
 *                            file, writes always go at the end.
 *
 * The character 'b' has no effect, "wbu+" is the same as "w+u" and "wu+",
 * allowed for ISO C standard conformance. The character 'u' requests for
 * a rollback file. All changes to the given file will be tracked by
 * maintaining a rollback-file. If power down ocurs before the file is closed,
 * upon reboot all writes to the file will get undone, the file will reset to
 * its original-contents that it had before the call to efs_open() was made.
 * If the file was a new-file and was created only in the previous boot
 * session, then it will get deleted.
 *
 * - Rollback is only supported for EFS2, and not supported on any
 *    other insertable-media. Do not create/open files with this 'u'
 *    option for any other media.
 * - The rollback-file grows proportional with the number of bytes
 *    that gets written efs_efwrite() calls. For example, after opening
 *    a 10-byte file, if we rewrite every byte 10-times, then the size
 *    of the rollback will be 100-bytes + overhead-bytes. The overhead
 *    bytes in this case would be (40-bytes + 120-bytes).
 * - The rollback-feature is in best use, if used on large-files that
 *    gets updated in small-sizes.
 * - The rollback-file is stored on EFS2, so please make sure that
 *    there is enough space on EFS2 for the rollback-file. The size
 *    of the rollback-file is proportional to the number of writes
 *    plus the amount of bytes being overwritten on the original file.
 *
 * Opening a file for reading ('r' at the first character of mode) will fail
 * if the file does not exist.
 *
 * When using append mode ('a' as the first character of mode) all write will
 * go to the end of the file, regardless of efs_efseek() calls.  Also, all
 * read operations will be unbuffered.
 *
 * If the '+' character is present both read and writes may be performed. If
 * the stream is buffered the application has to ensure that between every
 * write operation (efs_efwrite()) and the following read operation
 * (efs_efread()) there is a efs_efflush() or efs_efseek(). This will
 * guarantee that all the data in the buffer is flushed to disk. [POSIX 2004
 * Standard Sytem Interfaces, Issue 6 line 12882]
 *
 * All files operations using the same handle are thread safe. It's not
 * recommended to use the same file descriptor on different file handles or
 * mixing the APIs defined in fs_public.h with the ones defined here. If the
 * application decides doing this, it will need to guarantee no concurrent
 * access are made to the file descriptor.
 *
 * @note
 * Every opened file is considered unbuffered. The application needs to
 * call efs_esetvbuf() to set buffering mode. [Contrary to the 2004 POSIX
 * Standard System Interfaces, Issue 6 line 12886]
 *
 * @param path Path of file to be open.
 * @param mode Mode for opening the file.
 *
 * @return If successful, returns pointer to the object controlling the stream.
 *         On error NULL and the efs_errno is set accordingly.
 *
 * @par Errors:
 * ::EEXIST - Cannot create a file with the pathname because another file
 *            with the same name exists and an exclusive open is requested
 *            or a special (exclusive) file with the same pathname exists.\n
 * ::ENOENT - No entry for the pathname is found, the file cannot be
 *            opened (and a new file is not created because the O_CREAT
 *            flag is not supplied).\n
 * ::EMFILE - Maximum number of open descriptor is exceeded.\n
 * ::EISDIR - Opening a file with  a write flag (O_WRONLY or O_RDWR)
 *            denied because a directory with the same name exists.\n
 * ::ENOSPC - No space left on the device.\n
 * ::ENAMETOOLONG - Filename/directory name exceeded NAME_MAX limit or the
 *                  pathname exceeded PATH_MAX limit.\n
 * ::ENOMEM - No more dynamic memory is available.\n
 * ::ENODEV - The device does not exist.\n
 * ::ENOTDIR - The file could not be created under a path that is not
 *            a directory. Another possibility is an open with the
 *            O_CREAT flag tried to create a file in the rom file system.\n

/**
 * @brief Create a stream from an existing file descriptor.

 * file with efs_open() used the same mode than when efs_efdopen() is called,
 * with the exception of the rollback flag. When opening a file using modes
 * that begins with 'w' will not truncate the file. Requests to create a

 * to create a rollback file.
 *
 * When using efs_efdopen(), efs_efopen() or efs_open() and creating multiple
 * handles for the same file, the application has to guarantee that only one
 * thread is doing file operations (e.g. read, write, seek) on the opened file
 * at a time. The file offset is handled differently when using efs_open() and
 * having a stream handler (by calling efs_efopen() or efs_efdopen()),
 * therefore the application has to ensure that efs_lseek() and the next
 * efs_read() or efs_write() are atomic. This is handled transparently for the

/**
 * @brief Assign buffering to a stream
 *
 * Using a buffer allows read and writes to go into an intermediate memory

 * when there is data in the buffer. It is useful in applications where you
 * don't care about reliability or need high read/write throughput. There are

 *  - EFS_IOFBF fully buffered.
 *  - EFS_IONBF no buffering, same as writing every time to the device. Default
 *              mode when opening a file.
 *  - Line buffering is not implemented (EFS_IOLBF).
 *
 * When a file is opened it's assumed to be in no buffering mode. In fully
 * buffered mode the data is written to the device if the buffer is full or if
 * a efs_efflush(), efs_close(), efs_efseek() or efs_esetvbuf() command is
 * called.
 *
 * If <b>input_buf</b> is a NULL pointer, setvbuf will assume no buffering mode
 * (difference with POSIX standard). If not, it will use the user supplied
 * buf and size. For best performance size should be a multiple of the block
 * size of the device we are writing to. If this information is not known the
 * value of the field f_maxwrite returned by efs_statvfs() or efs_fstatvfs()
 * be used instead. The maximum size of the buffer is 2^32 = 4GBytes.
 *
 * If setvbuf is called and we already are in buffered mode, the buffer is
 * flushed before changing the buffer.
 *
 * When in append mode and using the buffer, all writes are buffered
 * and reads are unbuffered. The file position indicator will move
 * if we read/write but writes will always go at the end of the file in
 * append mode.
 *
 * @param stream File pointer.
