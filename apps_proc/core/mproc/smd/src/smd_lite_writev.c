/**
 * Writes data from the provided vector to the SMD port.
 *
 * Packet mode: The vector is treated as a single packet to be sent to the
 * remote processor. By default, the packet will be sent in its entirety if
 * space is available in the outgoing FIFO or will be dropped (with an
 * appropriate error code) if space is not available.
 *
 * Streaming mode: This function will write as much of the provided vector as
 * is possible, limited by the value returned by smdl_tx_peek(). This function
 * will return the number of successfully written bytes. Any bytes that cannot
 * fit in the outgoing FIFO will be truncated.
 *
 * In both streaming and packet mode, clients may specify the
 * #SMDL_WRITE_FLAG_LONG bit of \c flags to enable writing messages longer
 * than the FIFO. In this mode, smdl_writev() will write as much of the
 * message as is possible, then return #SMDL_CONTINUE. It is the
 * responsibility of the client to wait until it receives #SMDL_EVENT_WRITE,
 * then call smdl_writev() with the same arguments. smdl_writev() will
 * again write as much data as can be written. Once smdl_writev() has written
 * the entire message, it will return the size of the whole message.
 *
 * Writing 0 bytes to the port will not change shared memory and will not
 * signal the remote processor.
 *
 * Clients interested in determining the maximum packet size that can be
 * written to the port (without specifying #SMDL_WRITE_FLAG_LONG) may call
 * smdl_tx_peek().
 *
 * @param[in]  port    The port to write data to
 * @param[in]  iovec   Pointer to a linked list of I/O vectors to be written
 *                     to the port.
 * @param[in]  flags   Bitwise-or of flags controlling SMD's behavior. See
 *                     #SMDL_WRITE_FLAGS_NONE and #SMDL_WRITE_FLAG_NOINT.
 *
 * @return       -If the port is not fully opened, or the receiver has disabled
 *                inbound flow: 0.
 *                Other return behavior depends on the transfer mode used.
 *               -If #SMDL_WRITE_FLAG_LONG is specified:
 *                 -If the whole message has been written: The size of the
 *                  message.
 *                 -If the whole message has not been written: #SMDL_CONTINUE.
 *               -Packet mode: 
 *                 -If the port has sufficient space to hold the 
 *                  provided packet: The length of the packet written to the 
 *                  port.
 *                 -If the port does not have sufficient space to 
 *                  hold the provided packet: 0.
 *               -Streaming mode: The number of bytes that were successfully 
 *                written to the port. If truncated, will be less than the
 *                total amount of data available in the vector.
 * @return       If an error occurred: A negative error code.
 *
 * @sideeffects  Writes to shared memory and signals the remote processor.
