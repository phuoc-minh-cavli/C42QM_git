$Header: //components/rel/core.tx/6.0/mproc/smem/src/smem_partition.h#1 $

when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
10/09/13   bt      Add offset_mapped_un/cached to smem_partition_info_type.
06/25/13   pa      Added canary and padding size to allocation header.
                   Changed documentation and naming from 'upwards' to 
                   'uncached' and 'downwards' to 'cached' to avoid confusion.
                   Removed list references and smem_partition_item_info_type.
04/24/13   pa      Initial version.
