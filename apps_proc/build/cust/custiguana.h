--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
10/05/05   AMW     Added BUILD_JFLASH exception
09/21/05   AMW     Added test for building boot and tools
04/25/05   CEP     Removed FEATURE_IG_USB and FEATURE_L4LINUX_USB_TPOS, as
                   that functionality is now in APS, part of AMSS

  #ifdef FEATURE_IG_UART
  /* The kdb in the pistachio kernel talks directly to the physcial UARTS, and
     uses this feature to decide which UART to use.

     The scons build system uses FEATURE_L4LINUX_UART1 and FEATURE_L4LINUX_UART2
     below to set up linux configuration variables CONFIG_FEATURE_L4LINUX_UART1
     and CONFIG_FEATURE_L4LINUX_UART2. It is not intelligent enough to identify
     "C" style comments. It searches for "#define 'single space'
     FEATURE_L4LINUX_UARTx". Thus take care how the two features below appear
     in this h file.

     SIMPLY COMMENTING OUT THE #DEFINE IS NOT ENOUGH TO DISABLE THE FEATURE!!!
    #define "delete this and uncomment line to define this feature" FEATURE_L4LINUX_UART1
