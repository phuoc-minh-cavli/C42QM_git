// Name:        lz.c
// Author:      Marcus Geelnard
// Description: LZ77 coder/decoder implementation.
// Reentrant:   Yes
// $ATH_LICENSE_NULL$
//
// The LZ77 compression scheme is a substitutional compression scheme
// proposed by Abraham Lempel and Jakob Ziv in 1977. It is very simple in
// its design, and uses no fancy bit level compression.
//
// This is my first attempt at an implementation of a LZ77 code/decoder.
//
// The principle of the LZ77 compression algorithm is to store repeated
// occurrences of strings as references to previous occurrences of the same
// string. The point is that the reference consumes less space than the
// string itself, provided that the string is long enough (in this
// implementation, the string has to be at least 4 bytes long, since the
// minimum coded reference is 3 bytes long). Also note that the term
// "string" refers to any kind of byte sequence (it does not have to be
// an ASCII string, for instance).
//
// The coder uses a brute force approach to finding string matches in the
// history buffer (or "sliding window", if you wish), which is very, very
// slow. I recon the complexity is somewhere between O(n^2) and O(n^3),
// depending on the input data.
//
// There is also a faster implementation that uses a large working buffer
// in which a "jump table" is stored, which is used to quickly find
// possible string matches (see the source code for LZ_CompressFast() for
// more information). The faster method is an order of magnitude faster,
// but still quite slow compared to other compression methods.
//
// The upside is that decompression is very fast, and the compression ratio
// is often very good.
//
// The reference to a string is coded as a (length,offset) pair, where the
// length indicates the length of the string, and the offset gives the
// offset from the current data position. To distinguish between string
// references and literal strings (uncompressed bytes), a string reference
// is preceded by a marker byte, which is chosen as the least common byte
// symbol in the input data stream (this marker byte is stored in the
// output stream as the first byte).
//
// Occurrences of the marker byte in the stream are encoded as the marker
// byte followed by a zero byte, which means that occurrences of the marker
// byte have to be coded with two bytes.
//
// The lengths and offsets are coded in a variable length fashion, allowing
// values of any magnitude (up to 4294967295 in this implementation).
//
// With this compression scheme, the worst case compression result is
// (257/256)*insize + 1.
